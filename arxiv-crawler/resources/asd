1	0704.0006	Bosonic characters of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance	2007-03-31	\N	\N	  We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with\ntunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair\nwave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by\nthe correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and\nannihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a\nthree-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are\nexamined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order\n(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the\nside with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by\nODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found\nthat at $(k_F a)^{-1} \\ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more\nthan 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.\n	10.1103/PhysRevA.75.043613	cond-mat.mes-hall	6 pages, 4 figures, accepted by PRA

We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the\nPEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction,\nrelative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0\n--> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From these\nresults, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), the\nnormalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/-\n0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic,\nand from external inputs, respectively.\n	10.1103/PhysRevD.76.052005	hep-ex	21 pages, 13 postscript figures, submitted to Phys.

We present\nexact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function\nand optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich\npolaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and\ninteracting with phonons hole in the t-J model.\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-6348-0_12	cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.stat-mech	41 pages, 13 figures, in "Polarons in Advanced Materials" ed.

Vol. 140 pp77-89 (2005)	  We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation\neffects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime\nwhere itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations\nand static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several\ninteresting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the\nspectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral\nfunction for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since\nthe optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral\nfunction, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low\nfrequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double\nkondo peak arrangement\n	10.1007/s10909-005-6013-6	cond-mat.str-el	Reprint to improve access. 13 pages, 6 figures.
5	0704.0044	Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in\n  magnetized weakly collisional plasmas	2007-03-31	2009-05-09	ApJS 182, 310 (2009)	  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the "inertial range" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the "dissipation range" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n	10.1088/0067-0049/182/1/310	astro-ph nlin.CD physics.plasm-ph physics.space-ph	aastex using emulateapj, 65 pages, 10 figures; replaced to match\n  published version
6	0704.0058	Intelligent Life in Cosmology	2007-03-31	\N	International Journal of Astrobiology 2 (2003) 141-148	  I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is\nvery rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of\nthe founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the\nevolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall\ndevelop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show\nthat if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available\nresources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle\nof unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to\nsurvive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is\nindeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent\nlife, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I\nshall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over\nantimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.\n	10.1017/S1473550403001526	physics.pop-ph	\N

8	0704.0146	Vortices in Bose-Einstein Condensates: Theory	2007-04-02	\N	\N	  Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid\nflow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated\nwith a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\\Gamma=\\oint {\\rm d}{\\bf\nr}\\cdot{\\bf v}({\\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\\bf v}({\\bf r})$ is the\nfluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of\ncirculation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum\nis constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized\nvortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.\nIn BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including\nsingle vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent\nobservation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear\nsignature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In\naddition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear\noptics, and type-II superconductors.\n	10.1007/978-3-540-73591-5_9	cond-mat.other	17 pages, 2 figures.

9	0704.0155	A computer program for fast non-LTE analysis of interstellar line\n  spectra	2007-04-02	\N	\N	  The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line\nobservations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and\nchemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. We\npresent a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecular\nlines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibrium\ncalculations involving collisional and radiative processes and including\nradiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an\nescape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web at\nhttp://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml . The program makes use of\nmolecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database\n(LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The performance of\nthe program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticated\nmethods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters\nfrom line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program should\nform an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radio\nand infrared telescopes.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20066820	astro-ph	Accepted by A&A; 18 A4 pages, 11 figures

11	0704.0241	Superconducting states of the quasi-2D Holstein model: Effects of vertex\n  and non-local corrections	2007-04-02	\N	J. Phys.: Condens. Matter vol. 17 (2005) 5663-5676	  I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the\ndynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations\n(non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and\nincorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation\nis expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the\nbandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are\ncalculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond\nMigdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows\nmomentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order\nis suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to\nHohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.\n	10.1088/0953-8984/17/37/005	cond-mat.supr-con	Reprint to improve access. 14 pages. 10 figures.
12	0704.0370	Shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque and microwave\n  generation without magnetic field	2007-04-03	\N	\N	  The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of the\nmost important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the\nspin transfer phenomenon. We report transport and microwave power measurements\non specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependence\nof the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoretical\nmodels. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized\nby large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also\npredicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This\ntype of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the\nimplementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generate\nmicrowave oscillations without applied magnetic field.

New applications exploiting the quantum\nproperties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or\npairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on\nsingle-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum\ndot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating\nindistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such\nstructures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like\nsemiconductor devices for quantum light generation.\n	10.1038/nphoton.2007.46	quant-ph	preprint version

B 73, 195328 (2006)	  Theoretical description of the field emission of electrons from nanoscale\nobjects weakly coupled to the cathode is presented. It is shown that the field-\nemission current increases in a step-like fashion due to single-electron\ncharging which leads to abrupt changes of the effective electric field\nresponsible for the field emission. A detailed consideration of the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics is carried out for a nanocluster modelled by a\nmetallic spherical particle in the close vicinity of the cathode and for a\ncylindrical silicon nanowire grown on the cathode surface.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.73.195328	cond-mat.mes-hall	\N
16	0704.0441	Evidence for a planetary companion around a nearby young star	2007-04-03	\N	\N	  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD\n70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age\nestimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations\nof this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our\nspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about\n100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\nsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\nthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a\nperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of\nthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3\ndays. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff\nvariation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation\nbetween the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the\nrotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the\nlong-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass\ncompanion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial\nvelocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host\nstar, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which\nlies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.\nThe orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery\naround the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris\ndisks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.\n	10.1086/518213	astro-ph	11 pages, 4 figures, to be published in ApJL

A prototype of such a structure\nis YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag\nsheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition\nof the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation\ntransition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices\nare free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal\ndimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport\ncurrent are obtained.

The high spatial resolution of the MSX\nobservations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the\nsky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches\nwell the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path\nacross the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest\nregion of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.\n  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway\nstars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A\nrunaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with\nour results.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20077304	astro-ph	Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics (letters); 5 pages, 3 figures

An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all four\nobserved IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um.

This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared\nwaveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that the\ninfrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possible\ncontributions from ionic lines.

Evidence for this has been found for\nmany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test\nfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all\none-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same\ndistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.\nWe break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction\nterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from\nexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and\ndepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the\nexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing\nsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier\ncoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect\nto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for\nexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic\ncurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order\nbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank\nover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several\nfamilies of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,\ndepending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced\ntorsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).\n	10.4064/aa137-1-3	math.NT	38 pages, version 2.2: fixed some typos, included some comments from\n  Steven Finch which give more rapidly converging expressions for the constants\n  gamma_{PNT}, gamma_{PNT,1,3} and gamma_{PNT,1,4}, updated references

Similar skeletal structures in size up to 1.5 10^28 cm\nare found also in the redshift maps of quasars.\n	10.1063/1.2189125	astro-ph	10 pages, 14 figures, paper was been represented in 1st Crisis in\n  Cosmology Conference, CCC1

This is accompanied by a strain which recovers on removing\nthe magnetic field giving the system a magnetically superelastic character. A\nfurther property of this alloy is that it also shows the inverse magnetocaloric\neffect. The magnetic superelasticity and the inverse magnetocaloric effect in\nNi-Mn-In and their association with the first order structural transition is\nstudied by magnetization, strain, and neutron diffraction studies under\nmagnetic field.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.75.104414	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	6 pages, 8 figures.

49	0704.1502	Evolution of Magnetic Fields in Stars Across the Upper Main Sequence:\n  II. Observed distribution of the magnetic field geometry	2007-04-11	\N	\N	  We re-discuss the evolutionary state of upper main sequence magnetic stars\nusing a sample of Ap and Bp stars with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes and\ndefinitely determined longitudinal magnetic fields. We confirm our previous\nresults obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements\nof the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that\nmagnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the\nmain-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be\nconcentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby\nopen clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions.\nStronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive\nstars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found\nfor any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic\nflux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An\nexcess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and\nlower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the\ndistribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become\nobservable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main\nsequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg\nor 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be\nsomewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for\nan increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M\n> 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun. However, the\npredominance of high values of beta at advanced ages in these stars is notable.\n	10.1002/asna.200710773	astro-ph	16 pages, 22 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication in AN

The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectral\nmethods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle\nconcentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range\n34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on\nspatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs,\nwhich is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading\nwithin the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form\nof this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range\nconsidered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade\nmodel to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle\nconcentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of\nconcentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be\nin excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations.\nProbabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers\nwell beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly\nindicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of\nhigh particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from\nunloaded runs. Particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100\ntimes the gas density. This approach has promise for significant computational\nsavings in certain applications.\n	10.1103/PhysRevE.75.056305	astro-ph	Accepted by Phys. Rev.

Changing the initial distributions of rotation\nand magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19\nmodels. By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic\nfields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the\nblack-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the\nmicrophysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the\nneutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we\nfind that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves\nif the initial magnetic field is as large as $10^{12}$ G. We point out that the\nblack-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on\nthe other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino\nproperties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an\nimportant role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more\ndominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic\nfields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic\npressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the\nsuppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.4.771	astro-ph	24 pages, 17 figures.

Rev B. 76, 073103 (2007)	  We determine the electronic structure of a graphene sheet on top of a\nlattice-matched hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate using ab initio\ndensity functional calculations. The most stable configuration has one carbon\natom on top of a boron atom, the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting\ninequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV\nat the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions.\nAlternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate\nsimilar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can\ngreatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based\nfield effect transistors.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.76.073103	cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall	5 pages, 4 figures, Phys.

We\nexperimentally investigated the triboelectrification between two smooth\nmonocrystalline &#945;-Al 2O 3 (sapphire) antagonists by surface force\nmeasurements with a Surface Force Apparatus (SFA). The force between a sphere\nand a plane, both in sapphire, was measured as a function of the sphere-plane\ndistance D, before and after nano-friction tests, under dry argon atmosphere.\nRespective contributions of van der Waals, water meniscus and electrostatic\nforces were determined. The estimated Hamaker constant was in good agreement\nwith the Lifshitz theory, and the dominant meniscus attraction at low\nseparation could be overcome with small radius sphere. We demonstrated that\nelectrostatic forces were generated by the nano-friction test and we quantified\nthe adhesion that results from this contact-electrification. In the first stage\nof the unloading process, the short range electrostatic force was found to vary\nboth with time and distance D. Experimental results were correlated with\nsurface densities of mobile charges on the two surfaces, and the\ntime-dependence was related to classical surface transport phenomena on alumina\nsurfaces.\n	10.1051/epjap:2004152	physics.class-ph	\N
71	0704.2043	Enhanced Half-Metallicity in Edge-Oxidized Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons	2007-04-16	\N	Nano Letters 7, 2295-2299 (2007)	  We present a novel comprehensive first-principles theoretical study of the\nelectronic properties and relative stabilities of edge-oxidized zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons. The oxidation schemes considered include hydroxyl, carboxyl,\nether, and ketone groups. Using screened exchange density functional theory, we\nshow that these oxidized ribbons are more stable than hydrogen-terminated\nnanoribbons except for the case of the etheric groups. The stable oxidized\nconfigurations maintain a spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic\nordering localized at the edges, similar to the fully hydrogenated\ncounterparts. More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onset\nelectric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overall\nfield range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallic\nstate is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensity\nproduces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where the\nmagnetization is quenched completely. Finally, we find that oxygen containing\nedge groups have a minor effect on the energy difference between the\nantiferromagnetic ground state and the above-lying ferromagnetic state.\n	10.1021/nl0708922	cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.other	5 pages,5 figures, 1 table

Simulating the model in the computer,\nfaithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along\nthe cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation\nmodels, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory\ncircuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological\ndynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the\nbiological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state\nspace, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive\ntrajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of\nthe corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in\ncircuitry, as well as dynamics is observed.

We show that the degree of\nentanglement and the time it takes for the entanglement to reach its optimum\nvalue is a sensitive function the initial conditions and the position of the\natoms inside the cavity mode. It is found that the entangled properties of the\ntwo atoms can readily be extracted from dynamics of a simple two-level system.\nEffectively, we engineer two coupled qubits whose the dynamics are analogous to\nthat of a driven single two-level system. It is found that spatial variations\nof the coupling constants actually help to create transient entanglement which\nmay appear on the time scale much longer than that predicted for the case of\nequal coupling constants. When the atoms are initially prepared in an entangled\nstate, they may remain entangled for all times. We also find that the\nentanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when the the\natoms are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode. The\ndiffraction pattern of the entanglement varies with time and we explain this\neffect in terms of the quantum property of complementarity, which is manifested\nas a tradeoff between the knowledge of energy of the exchanged photon versus\nthe evolution time of the system.\n	10.1103/PhysRevA.75.042307	quant-ph	Phys.

Because this maser can be so strong (up\nto thousands of Janskys), it was very helpful during the commissioning phase of\nthe highest frequency band (620-700 GHz) of the Submillimeter Array (SMA)\ninterferometer. From late 2002 to early 2006, brief attempts were made to\nsearch for emission from additional sources beyond the original CSO survey.\nThese efforts have expanded the source count from 10 to 16. The maser emission\nappears to be quite compact spatially, as expected from theoretical\nconsiderations; thus these objects can potentially be used as atmospheric phase\ncalibrators. Many of these objects also exhibit maser emission in the\nvibrationally-excited SiO maser at 215 GHz. Because both maser lines likely\noriginate from a similar physical region, these objects can be used to test\ntechniques of phase transfer calibration between millimeter and submillimeter\nbands. The 658 GHz masers will be important beacons to assess the performance\nof the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in this challenging high-frequency\nband.\n	10.1017/S1743921307013634	astro-ph	8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables; based on an oral presentation at IAU\n  conference 242: Astrophysical Masers and Their Environments, held in Alice\n  Springs, Australia (March 2007)

Being an\nold and rich cluster, M67 is a relevant object for the analysis of the Galactic\ndisk evolution. M67 is well studied but the lack of a wide and deep Stromgren\nphotometric study makes our results worthwhile. The brightest stars of the open\ncluster M67 were used as uvby-Hbeta standard stars in our studies of NGC1817\nand NGC2548, and the extension of the field covered, as well as the amount of\nobservations, allowed to obtain the best set of Stromgren data ever published\nfor this cluster. We discuss the results of our CCD uvby-Hbeta\nintermediate-band photometry, covering an area of about 50'x50' down to V 19.\nMoreover, a complete membership segregation based on astrometric and\nphotometric criteria is obtained. The photometric analysis of a selected sample\nof stars yields a reddening value of E(b-y)= 0.03\\pm0.03, a distance modulus of\nV_0-M_V= 9.7\\pm0.2 and [Fe/H]= 0.01\\pm0.14.

A clump of approximately 60 stars\naround V= 16, (b-y)= 0.4 could be interpreted as a population of\npre-cataclysmic variable stars (if members), or as a stream of field G-type\nstars placed at twice the distance of the cluster (if non-members).\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20067003	astro-ph	16 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in A&A

102	0704.2910	Scanning-probe spectroscopy of semiconductor donor molecules	2007-04-22	2007-12-24	Nature Physics 4, 227 (2008).	  Semiconductor devices continue to press into the nanoscale regime, and new\napplications have emerged for which the quantum properties of dopant atoms act\nas the functional part of the device, underscoring the necessity to probe the\nquantum structure of small numbers of dopant atoms in semiconductors[1-3].\nAlthough dopant properties are well-understood with respect to bulk\nsemiconductors, new questions arise in nanosystems. For example, the quantum\nenergy levels of dopants will be affected by the proximity of nanometer-scale\nelectrodes. Moreover, because shallow donors and acceptors are analogous to\nhydrogen atoms, experiments on small numbers of dopants have the potential to\nbe a testing ground for fundamental questions of atomic and molecular physics,\nsuch as the maximum negative ionization of a molecule with a given number of\npositive ions[4,5]. Electron tunneling spectroscopy through isolated dopants\nhas been observed in transport studies[6,7]. In addition, Geim and coworkers\nidentified resonances due to two closely spaced donors, effectively forming\ndonor molecules[8]. Here we present capacitance spectroscopy measurements of\nsilicon donors in a gallium-arsenide heterostructure using a scanning probe\ntechnique[9,10]. In contrast to the work of Geim et al., our data show\ndiscernible peaks attributed to successive electrons entering the molecules.\nHence this work represents the first addition spectrum measurement of dopant\nmolecules. More generally, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the\nfirst example of single-electron capacitance spectroscopy performed directly\nwith a scanning probe tip[9].\n	10.1038/nphys855	cond-mat.mes-hall	In press, Nature Physics.

(to be issued on June 25, 2007)	  We have performed self-consistent 2.5-dimensional nonsteady MHD numerical\nsimulations of jet formation as long as possible, including the dynamics of\naccretion disks. Although the previous nonsteady MHD simulations for\nastrophysical jets revealed that the characteristics of nonsteady jets are\nsimilar to those of steady jets, the calculation time of these simulations is\nvery short compared with the time scale of observed jets. Thus we have\ninvestigated long term evolutions of mass accretion rate, mass outflow rate,\njet velocity, and various energy flux. We found that the ejection of jet is\nquasi-periodic. The period of the ejection is related to the time needed for\nthe initial magnetic filed to be twisted to generate toroidal filed. We compare\nour results with both the steady state theory and previous 2.5-dimensional\nnonsteady MHD simulations.\n	10.1093/pasj/60.4.871	astro-ph	21 pages, 19 figures

105	0704.3005	A balanced memory network	2007-04-23	\N	\N	  A fundamental problem in neuroscience is understanding how working memory --\nthe ability to store information at intermediate timescales, like 10s of\nseconds -- is implemented in realistic neuronal networks. The most likely\ncandidate mechanism is the attractor network, and a great deal of effort has\ngone toward investigating it theoretically. Yet, despite almost a quarter\ncentury of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In\nparticular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it that\nattractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentally\nduring working memory tasks? And second, how many memories can be stored under\nbiologically realistic conditions? Here we answer both questions by studying an\nattractor neural network in which inhibition and excitation balance each other.\nUsing mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor\nnetworks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only\nif the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean field\nanalysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a network\nscales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has been\nsuggested for simple models but never shown for realistic ones. Both of these\npredictions are verified using simulations with large networks of spiking\nneurons.\n	10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030141	q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn	Accepted for publications in PLoS Comp. Biol

107	0704.3104	The first determination of the actinide Th abundance for a red giant of\n  the Ursa Minor dwarf galaxy	2007-04-23	\N	\N	  The Thorium abundance for the red giant COS82 in the Ursa Minor dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy is determined based on a high resolution spectrum. This is\nthe first detection of actinides in an extra Galactic object. A detailed\nabundance pattern is determined for 12 other neutron-capture elements from the\natomic number 39 to 68. These elements are significantly over-abundant with\nrespect to other metals like Fe (> 1 dex) and their abundance pattern agrees\nwell with those of the r-process-enhanced, very metal-poor stars known in the\nGalactic halo, while the metallicity of this object ([Fe/H] ~ -1.5) is much\nhigher than these field stars ([Fe/H] ~ -3.0). The results indicate that the\nmechanism and the astrophysical site that are responsible for neutron-capture\nelements in COS82 is similar to that for field r-process-enhanced stars, while\nthe condition of low mass star formation is quite different. An estimate of the\nage of this object based on the Th abundance ratio is discussed.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.3.L15	astro-ph	5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, to appear in PASJ

The\nconformation of folded state mimics the $\\beta$-sheet as seen in titin\nmolecule. Using exact enumeration technique, we study the extension-force and\nforce-temperature diagrams of such a system. Force-temperature diagram shows\nthe re-entrance behaviour for flexible chain. However, for stiff chain this\nre-entrance behaviour is absent and there is an enhancement in\n$\\theta$-temperature with the rise of stiffness. We further propose that the\ninternal information about the frozen structure of polymer can be read from the\ndistribution of end-to-end distance which shows saw-tooth like behaviour.\n	10.1103/PhysRevE.72.052901	cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph	RevTeX v4, 9 pages with 6 eps figures

113	0704.3203	The Infrared Extinction Law at Extreme Depth in a Dark Cloud Core	2007-04-24	\N	\N	  We combined sensitive near-infrared data obtained with ground-based imagers\non the ESO NTT and VLT telescopes with space mid-infrared data acquired with\nthe IRAC imager on the Spitzer Space Telescope to calculate the extinction law\nA_\\lambda/A_K as a function of \\lambda between 1.25 and 7.76 micron to an\nunprecedented depth in Barnard 59, a star forming, dense core located in the\nPipe Nebula. The ratios A_\\lambda/A_K were calculated from the slopes of the\ndistributions of sources in color-color diagrams \\lambda-K vs. H-K. The\ndistributions in the color-color diagrams are fit well with single slopes to\nextinction levels of A_K ~ 7 (A_V ~ 59 mag). Consequently, there appears to be\nno significant variation of the extinction law with depth through the B59 line\nof sight. However, when slopes are translated into the relative extinction\ncoefficients A_\\lambda/A_K, we find an extinction law which departs from the\nsimple extrapolation of the near-infrared power law extinction curve, and\nagrees more closely with a dust extinction model for a cloud with a total to\nselective absorption R_V=5.5 and a grain size distribution favoring larger\ngrains than those in the diffuse ISM. Thus, the difference we observe could be\npossibly due to the effect of grain growth in denser regions. Finally, the\nslopes in our diagrams are somewhat less steep than those from the study of\nIndebetouw et al. (2005) for clouds with lower column densities, and this\nindicates that the extinction law between 3 and 8 micron might vary slightly as\na function of environment.\n	10.1086/518928	astro-ph	22 pages manuscript, 4 figures (2 multipart), 1 table

In general, changes in\nprotein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and\ndegradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an\nadaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.\nUnder the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less\naffected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are\nlarge, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells\nare easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a\ncellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This\nleads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model\nsimulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results\nsuggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a\nprocess that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The\npresent scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses\nincluding the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.\n	10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040003	q-bio.MN	14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PLoS Computational Biology
122	0704.3419	Zakharov simulation study of spectral features of on-demand Langmuir\n  turbulence in an inhomogeneous plasma	2007-04-25	2007-08-11	\N	  We have performed a simulation study of Langmuir turbulence in the Earth's\nionosphere by means of a Zakharov model with parameters relevant for the F\nlayer. The model includes dissipative terms to model collisions and Landau\ndamping of the electrons and ions, and a linear density profile, which models\nthe ionospheric plasma inhomogeneity whose length scale is of the order 10--100\nkm. The injection of energy into the system is modeled by a constant source\nterm in the Zakharov equation. Langmuir turbulence is excited ``on-demand'' in\ncontrolled ionospheric modification experiments where the energy is provided by\nan HF radio beam injected into the overhead ionospheric plasma. The ensuing\nturbulence can be studied with radars and in the form of secondary radiation\nrecorded by ground-based receivers. We have analyzed spectral signatures of the\nturbulence for different sets of parameters and different altitudes relative to\nthe turning point of the linear Langmuir mode where the Langmuir frequency\nequals the local plasma frequency. By a parametric analysis, we have derived a\nsimple scaling law, which links the spectral width of the turbulent frequency\nspectrum to the physical parameters in the ionosphere. The scaling law provides\na quantitative relation between the physical parameters (temperatures, electron\nnumber density, ionospheric length scale, etc.) and the observed frequency\nspectrum. This law may be useful for interpreting experimental results.\n	10.1029/2007JA012491	physics.space-ph	7 pages, 8 figures

As already demonstrated in recent experiments,\na ring-shaped emission is obtained by applying two identical pump beams with\nopposite in-plane wavevectors, providing symmetrical signal and idler beams\nwith opposite in-plane wavevectors on the ring. We study the squeezing of the\nsignal-idler difference noise across the parametric instability threshold,\naccounting for the radiative and non-radiative losses, multiple scattering and\nstatic disorder. We compare the results of the complete multimode Monte Carlo\nsimulations with a simplified linearized quantum Langevin analytical model.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.76.115324	cond-mat.other	\N

We show that the presence of an electrode produces localized\nelectron/hole states near the electrode, a phenomenon only exhibited in\nnanostructures and overlooked in the past. This phenomenon will have profound\nimplications on electron transport in such nanosystems.

126	0704.3476	Suppression of growth by multiplicative white noise in a parametric\n  resonant system	2007-04-26	2011-10-28	\N	  The author studied the growth of the amplitude in a Mathieu-like equation\nwith multiplicative white noise. The approximate value of the exponent at the\nextremum on parametric resonance regions was obtained theoretically by\nintroducing the width of time interval, and the exponents were calculated\nnumerically by solving the stochastic differential equations by a symplectic\nnumerical method. The Mathieu-like equation contains a parameter $\\alpha$ that\nis determined by the intensity of noise and the strength of the coupling\nbetween the variable and the noise. The value of $\\alpha$ was restricted not to\nbe negative without loss of generality. It was shown that the exponent\ndecreases with $\\alpha$, reaches a minimum and increases after that. It was\nalso found that the exponent as a function of $\\alpha$ has only one minimum at\n$\\alpha \\neq 0$ on parametric resonance regions of $\\alpha = 0$. This minimum\nvalue is obtained theoretically and numerically. The existence of the minimum\nat $\\alpha \\neq 0$ indicates the suppression of the growth by multiplicative\nwhite noise.\n	10.1063/1.3431443	cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.other	The title and the description in the manuscript are changed

170	0705.0763	A new Generation of Spectrometer Calibration Techniques based on Optical\n  Frequency Combs	2007-05-05	\N	\N	  Typical astronomical spectrographs have a resolution ranging between a few\nhundred to 200.000. Deconvolution and correlation techniques are being employed\nwith a significance down to 1/1000 th of a pixel. HeAr and ThAr lamps are\nusually used for calibration in low and high resolution spectroscopy,\nrespectively. Unfortunately, the emitted lines typically cover only a small\nfraction of the spectrometer's spectral range. Furthermore, their exact\nposition depends strongly on environmental conditions. A problem is the strong\nintensity variation between different (intensity ratios {>300). In addition,\nthe brightness of the lamps is insufficient to illuminate a spectrograph via an\nintegrating sphere, which in turn is important to calibrate a long-slit\nspectrograph, as this is the only way to assure a uniform illumination of the\nspectrograph pupil.\n  Laboratory precision laser spectroscopy has experienced a major advance with\nthe development of optical frequency combs generated by pulsed femto-second\nlasers. These lasers emit a broad spectrum (several hundred nanometers in the\nvisible and near infra-red) of equally-spaced "comb" lines with almost uniform\nintensity (intensity ratios typically <10). Self-referencing of the laser\nestablishes a precise ruler in frequency space that can be stabilized to the\n10e-18 uncertainty level, reaching absolute frequency inaccuracies at the\n10e-12 level per day when using the Global Positioning System's (GPS) time\nsignal as the reference. The exploration of the merits of this new technology\nholds the promise for broad-band, highly accurate and reproducible calibration\nrequired for reliable operation of current and next generation astronomic\nspectrometers.\n	10.1007/978-3-540-76963-7_55	astro-ph	will be published in the proceedings of "The 2007 ESO Instrument\n  Calibration Workshop", Springer-Verlag series "ESO Astrophysics Symposia"
130	0704.3491	SuprimeCam Observation of Sporadic Meteors during Perseids 2004	2007-04-26	\N	\N	  We report the serendipitous findings of 13 faint meteors and 44 artificial\nspace objects by Subaru SuprimeCam imaging observations during 11-16 August\n2004. The meteors, at about 100km altitude, and artificial satellites/debris in\norbit, at 500km altitude or higher, were clearly discriminated by their\napparent defocused image sizes. CCD photometry of the 13 meteors, including 1\nPerseid, 1 Aquarid, and 11 sporadic meteors, was performed. We defined a peak\nvideo-rate magnitude by comparing the integrated photon counts from the\nbrightest portion of the track traversed within 33ms to those from a 0-mag star\nduring the same time duration. This definition gives magnitudes in the range\n4.0< V_{vr} <6.4 and 4.1< I_{vr}<5.9 for these 13 meteors. The corresponding\nmagnitude for virtual naked-eye observers could be somewhat fainter especially\nfor the V-band observation, in which the [OI] 5577 line lasting about 1 sec as\nan afterglow could contribute to the integrated flux of the present 5-10 min\nCCD exposures. Although the spatial resolution is insufficient to resolve the\nsource size of anything smaller than about 1 m, we developed a new estimate of\nthe collisionally excited column diameter of these meteors. A diameter as small\nas a few mm was derived from their collisionally excited photon rates, meteor\nspeed, and the volume density of the oxygen atoms at the 100km altitude. The\nactual column diameter of the radiating zone, however, could be as large as few\n100m because the excited atoms travel that distance before they emit forbidden\nlines in 0.7 sec of its average lifetime. Among the 44 artificial space\nobjects, we confirmed that 17 were cataloged satellites/space debris.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.4.841	astro-ph	14 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, submitted to PASJ
131	0704.3555	Atomic physics experiments with trapped and cooled highly charged ions	2007-04-26	\N	\N	  Trapping and cooling techniques have become very important for many\nfundamental experiments in atomic physics. When applied to highly charged ions\nconfined in Penning traps, these procedures are very effective for testing\nquantum electrodynamics in extreme electromagnetic fields produced by heavy\nhighly charged ions such as uranium U$^{91+}$. In addition, fundamental\nconstants or nuclear ground state properties can be determined with high\naccuracy in these simple systems. Finally, by studying a single trapped\nradioactive ion, its nuclear decay can be studied in detail by observing the\ndisappearance of the signal of the mother and the appearance of that of the\ndaughter isotope. Such experiments on highly charged ions at extremely low\nenergy will become possible by the HITRAP facility which is currently being\nbuilt up at GSI. Also the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research\n(FAIR) will be briefly described which is expected to be operational by 2014.\n	10.1088/1742-6596/58/1/002	physics.atom-ph physics.gen-ph	8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table. accepted for Journal of Physics\n  Conference Series (2006)

We\nobserved five points of the galaxy covering the entire region. After combining\nall of the spectra, we obtained a global spectrum with the rms noise level of\n3.3 mK in T_mb scale at a velocity resolution of 10 km s^-1. No significant\nemission was detected, though we find a marginal emission feature in the\nvelocity range corresponding to the redshift of the galaxy. We derive 3 sigma\nupper limits on the global properties: the velocity-integrated CO(3-2)\nintensity of I_CO(3-2) < 0.26 K km s^-1 by adopting a velocity width of 67 km\ns^-1; the H_2 column density of N(H_2) < 3 x 10^20 cm^-2; the molecular gas\nmass of M(H_2) < 3 x 10^8 M_sun, by assuming a CO line luminosity to H_2\nmolecular gas mass conversion factor of X_CO = 5.0 x 10^20 cm^-2 (K km\ns^-1)^-1; and the star formation rate of SFR < 0.1 M_sun yr^-1, based on the\nSchmidt law. The SFR is consistent with the previous results of H_alpha and\nmid-IR observations, thereby suggesting that there is no significant obscured\nstar formation in the host galaxy of GRB 980425. This result implies that there\nis a variety of GRB hosts with regard to the presence of obscured star\nformation.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.1.67	astro-ph	7 pages, 4 figures

The presence of this\n{\\it thin spectrum} is a generic feature and related to the fact that in a\nsuperconductor the global phase rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken. For\na strong coupling superconductor we find the spectrum by exactly solving the\nLieb-Mattis type Hamiltonian onto which the problem maps. One of the physical\nconsequences of the presence of thin states is that they cause quantum\ndecoherence in superconducting qubits of finite extent.\n	10.1016/j.physb.2008.04.020	cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el	4 pages, 2 figures

The\nproposed procedure guarantees a highly accurate evaluation of the overlap\nintegrals with arbitrary values of quantum numbers, screening constants and\ninternuclear distances. It is demonstrated that the computational accuracy of\nthe proposed procedure is not only dependent on the efficiency of formulas, as\nhas been discussed previously, but also on a number of other factors including\nthe used program language package and solvent properties. The numerical results\nobtained using the algorithm described in the present work are in a complete\nagreement with those obtained using the alternative evaluation procedure.

136	0704.3724	A Model of Late Long-Term Potentiation Simulates Aspects of Memory\n  Maintenance	2007-04-27	\N	\N	  Late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) appears essential for the formation of\nlong-term memory, with memories at least partly encoded by patterns of\nstrengthened synapses. How memories are preserved for months or years, despite\nmolecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal\nactivity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to\npreferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis\nhas not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing\nbiochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into\ntwo such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential\nbiochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model\nrepresents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed\nmodel adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled\nas continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of\nsynaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the\namplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or\ntheta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high\nweight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter\nvariations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset\nsynapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,\nepisodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.\nBoth models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are\nexpected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to\nmaintenance of synaptic strength.\n	10.1371/journal.pone.0000445	q-bio.NC q-bio.MN	Accepted to PLoS One. 8 figures at end

In the hydrodynamic scaling limit, L to infinity, the\nleading order (O(L)) behavior of this entropy has been shown by Bahadoran to be\nthat of a product measure corresponding to strict local equilibrium; we compute\nthe first correction, which is O(1). The computation uses a formal expansion of\nthe entropy in terms of truncated correlation functions; for this system the\nk-th such correlation is shown to be O(L^{-k+1}). This entropy correction\ndepends only on the scaled truncated pair correlation, which describes the\ncovariance of the density field. It coincides, in the large L limit, with the\ncorresponding correction obtained from a Gaussian measure with the same\ncovariance.\n	10.1007/s10955-006-9160-5	cond-mat.stat-mech	Latex, 28 pages, 4 figures as eps files
138	0704.3803	Are the most metal-poor galaxies young?	2007-04-28	\N	\N	  We review the possibility that metallicity could provide a diagnostic for the\nage of a galaxy, hence that the most metal-poor star forming galaxies in the\nlocal universe may be genuinely young. Indeed, observational evidence for\ndownsizing shows the average age of the stars in a galaxy to decrease with\ndecreasing mass and metallicity. However, we conclude both from observational\nand theoretical viewpoints that metallicity is not an arrow of time.\nConsequently the most metal poor galaxies of our local universe are not\nnecessarely young. Current observations suggest that an old stellar population\nis present in all metal-poor galaxies, although a couple of cases, e.g. IZw18,\nremain under debate. Further observations with more sentitive equipement should\nsettle this question in the coming years.\n	10.1017/S1743921306005060	astro-ph	Galaxy Evolution across the Hubble Time Proceedings IAU Symposium No.\n  235, 2006 F.Combes and J.

Decoherence effects are considered\nby analyzing the couplings of the condensate to environments. Two kinds of\ncoupling are taken into account. With the first kind of coupling dominated, the\ndecoherence can enhance the self-trapping by increasing the damping of the\noscillations in the dynamics, while the decoherence from the second kind of\ncondensate-environment coupling leads to spoiling of the quantum tunneling and\nself-trapping.\n	10.1103/PhysRevA.75.045601	quant-ph	for color figures, see PRA

Each of the five targets (RXS\nJ08066+7248, RXS J16290+4007, RXS J16333+4718, RXS J16446+2619, and B3\n1702+457) in milli-Jansky levels were detected and unresolved in\nmilli-arcsecond resolutions, i.e., with brightness temperatures higher than\n10^7 K. The nonthermal processes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity,\nrather than starbursts, are predominantly responsible for the radio emissions\nfrom these NLS1s. Out of the nine known radio-loud NLS1s, including the ones\nchosen for this study, we found that the four most radio-loud objects\nexclusively have inverted spectra. This suggests a possibility that these NLS1s\nare radio-loud due to Doppler beaming, which can apparently enhance both the\nradio power and the spectral frequency.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.4.703	astro-ph	8 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ

This makes it a highly\nexpressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting\ncorrectness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal\n\\lambda-calculus.\n  This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In\nparticular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of\nbounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness\nfor model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint\nelimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the\nsize of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying\ntransition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a\nsimple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression\ncomplexity of each such fragment.\n  The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for\nalternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there\nare fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with\nrespect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold\nexponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL,\nprovided m exceeds 3. This also yields a hierarchy result in expressive power.\n	10.2168/LMCS-3(2:7)2007	cs.LO	33 pages, 2 figures, to be published in Logical Methods in Computer\n  Science

147	0705.0048	Horizon-Penetrating Transonic Accretion Disks around Rotating Black\n  Holes	2007-04-30	\N	\N	  The stationary hydrodynamic equations for the transonic accretion disks and\nflows around rotating black holes are presented by using the Kerr-Schild\ncoordinate where there is no coordinate singularity at the event horizon. We\nuse two types of the causal viscosity prescription, and the boundary conditions\nfor the transonic accretion flows are given at the sonic point. For one type of\nthe causal viscosity prescription we also add the boundary conditions at the\nviscous point where the accreting radial velocity is nearly equal to the\nviscous diffusion velocity. Based on the formalism for the transonic accretion\ndisks, after we present the calculation method of the transonic solutions, the\nhorizon-penetrating transonic solutions which smoothly pass the event horizon\nare calculated for several types of the accretion flow models: the ideal\nisothermal flows, the ideal and the viscous polytropic flows, the advection\ndominated accretion flows (ADAFs) with the relativistic equation of state, the\nadiabatic accretion disks, the standard accretion disks, the supercritical\naccretion disks. These solutions are obtained for both non-rotating and\nrotating black holes. The calculated accretion flows plunge into black hole\nwith finite three velocity smaller than the speed of light even at the event\nhorizon or inside the horizon, and the angular velocities of the accretion flow\nat the horizon are generally different from the angular velocity of the\nframe-dragging due to the black hole's rotation. These features contrast to the\nresults obtained by using the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate with the coordinate\nsingularity at the horizon.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.11877.x	astro-ph	MNRAS accepted

151	0705.0171	Radiation hardness of diamond and silicon sensors compared	2007-05-01	\N	Phys.StatusSolidi204:3009,2007	  The radiation hardness of silicon charged particle sensors is compared with\nsingle crystal and polycrystalline diamond sensors, both experimentally and\ntheoretically. It is shown that for Si- and C-sensors, the NIEL hypothesis,\nwhich states that the signal loss is proportional to the Non-Ionizing Energy\nLoss, is a good approximation to the present data. At incident proton and\nneutron energies well above 0.1 GeV the radiation damage is dominated by the\ninelastic cross section, while at non-relativistic energies the elastic cross\nsection prevails. The smaller inelastic nucleon-Carbon cross section and the\nlight nuclear fragments imply that at high energies diamond is an order of\nmagnitude more radiation hard than silicon, while at energies below 0.1 GeV the\ndifference becomes significantly smaller.\n	10.1002/pssa.200776327	physics.ins-det	6 pages, 4 figurs, invited talk at the Hasselt Diamond Workshop, Feb.\n  2007

Phys. 53, 073706 (2012)	  We consider the stability of the periodic Toda lattice (and slightly more\ngenerally of the algebro-geometric finite-gap lattice) under a short range\nperturbation. We prove that the perturbed lattice asymptotically approaches a\nmodulated lattice.\n  More precisely, let $g$ be the genus of the hyperelliptic curve associated\nwith the unperturbed solution. We show that, apart from the phenomenon of the\nsolitons travelling on the quasi-periodic background, the $n/t$-pane contains\n$g+2$ areas where the perturbed solution is close to a finite-gap solution in\nthe same isospectral torus. In between there are $g+1$ regions where the\nperturbed solution is asymptotically close to a modulated lattice which\nundergoes a continuous phase transition (in the Jacobian variety) and which\ninterpolates between these isospectral solutions. In the special case of the\nfree lattice ($g=0$) the isospectral torus consists of just one point and we\nrecover the known result.\n  Both the solutions in the isospectral torus and the phase transition are\nexplicitly characterized in terms of Abelian integrals on the underlying\nhyperelliptic curve.\n  Our method relies on the equivalence of the inverse spectral problem to a\nmatrix Riemann--Hilbert problem defined on the hyperelliptic curve and\ngeneralizes the so-called nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method\nfor Riemann--Hilbert problem deformations to Riemann surfaces.\n	10.1063/1.4731768	nlin.SI math-ph math.MP	38 pages, 1 figure.

Lett. 100, 096401 (2008)	  Spin Hall effect in metallic Pt is studied with first-principles relativistic\nband calculations. It is found that intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is\nas large as $\\sim 2000 (\\hbar/e)(\\Omega {\\rm cm})^{-1}$ at low temperature, and\ndecreases down to $\\sim 200 (\\hbar/e)(\\Omega {\\rm cm})^{-1}$ at room\ntemperature. It is due to the resonant contribution from the spin-orbit\nsplitting of the doubly degenerated $d$-bands at high-symmetry $L$ and $X$\npoints near the Fermi level. By modeling these near degeneracies by effective\nHamiltonian, we show that SHC has a peak near the Fermi energy and that the\nvertex correction due to impurity scattering vanishes. We therefore argue that\nthe large spin Hall effect observed experimentally in platinum is of intrinsic\nnature.\n	10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.096401	cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci	Accepted for publication in Phys.

In this paper\nwe introduce a new family of inequalities that quantify the extent of the\n"strictness" of the 1-negative type inequalities for finite metric trees. These\ninequalities of "enhanced 1-negative type" are sufficiently strong to imply\nthat any given finite metric tree must have strict p-negative type for all\nvalues of p in an open interval that contains the number 1. Moreover, these\nopen intervals can be characterized purely in terms of the unordered\ndistribution of edge weights that determine the path metric on the particular\ntree, and are therefore largely independent of the tree's internal geometry.\n  From these calculations we are able to extract a new non linear technique for\nimproving lower bounds on the maximal p-negative type of certain finite metric\nspaces.

161	0705.0494	Sgr A$^*$: a laboratory to measure the central black hole and cluster\n  parameters	2007-05-03	\N	\N	  Several stars orbit around a black hole candidate of mass $3.7\\times 10^6$\nM$_{\\odot}$, in the region of the Galactic Center (GC). Looking for General\nRelativistic (GR) periastron shifts is limited by the existence of a stellar\ncluster around the black hole that would modify the orbits due to classical\neffects that might mask the GR effect. Only if one knows the cluster parameters\n(its mass and core radius) it is possible to unequivocally deduce the GR\neffects expected and then test them. In this paper it is shown that the\nobservation of the proper motion of Sgr A$^*$, $v_{Sgr A^*} = (0.4\\pm 0.9)$ km\ns$^{-1}$ (\\citealt{reid2004}), could help us to constrain the cluster\nparameters significantly and that future measurements of the periastron shifts\nfor at least three stars may adequately determine the cluster parameters and\nthe mass of the black hole.\n	10.1086/517934	astro-ph	in press on PASP, 2007

We study the\nspectrum and lifetime of the metastable vacuum and possible embeddings of the\nmodel in UV complete theories. Then we consider larger gauge group theories\nwith flavors. We show that when we softly break them to N=1, the potential\ninduced on specific submanifolds of their moduli space is identical to the\npotential in lower rank gauge theories. Then we show that the potential\nincreases when we move away from this submanifold, allowing us to construct\nmetastable vacua on them in the theories that can be reduced to the SU(2) case.\n	10.1007/JHEP10(2013)060	hep-th	29 pages, 10 figures

171	0705.0779	Ageing memory and glassiness of a driven vortex system	2007-05-06	\N	Nature Physics, 3, 111 (2007)	  Many systems in nature, glasses, interfaces and fractures being some\nexamples, cannot equilibrate with their environment, which gives rise to novel\nand surprising behaviour such as memory effects, ageing and nonlinear dynamics.\nUnlike their equilibrated counterparts, the dynamics of out-of- equilibrium\nsystems is generally too complex to be captured by simple macroscopic laws.\nHere we investigate a system that straddles the boundary between glass and\ncrystal: a Bragg glass formed by vortices in a superconductor. We find that the\nresponse to an applied force evolves according to a stretched exponential, with\nthe exponent reflecting the deviation from equilibrium. After the force is\nremoved, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scales\nlinearly with its age (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slower\nthan younger ones. We show that simple ageing can occur naturally in the\npresence of sufficient quenched disorder. Moreover, the hierarchical\ndistribution of timescales, arising when chunks of loose vortices cannot move\nbefore trapped ones become dislodged, leads to a stretched-exponential\nresponse.\n	10.1038/nphys512	cond-mat.supr-con	16 pages, 5 figures

174	0705.0873	Modelling long-term trends in lunar exposure to the Earth's plasmasheet	2007-05-07	2007-07-31	Ann. Geophys., 25, 2037--2044, 2007	  This paper shows how the exposure of the Moon to the Earth's plasmasheet is\nsubject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key\nproperty of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that\norbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.\nThis precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the\nyear to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the\necliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number\nand duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a\ndetailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.\nThis shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10\nhours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per\nmonth at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the\naccumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.\nThus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the\neighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several\nobservations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to\nbombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we\nconclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year\ncycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar\nenvironment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the\ncycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is\nparticularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration\non the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.\n	10.5194/angeo-25-2037-2007	physics.space-ph	20 pages, 6 figures, re-submitted to Annales Geophysicae, for an\n  animated version of Figure 1 see\n  http://uk.geocities.com/mike.hapgood@btinternet.com/moon_movie_6.gif
175	0705.0877	Dependence of CMI Growth Rates on Electron Velocity Distributions and\n  Perturbation by Solitary Waves	2007-05-07	\N	\N	  We calculate growth rates and corresponding gains for RX and LO mode\nradiation associated with the cyclotron maser instability for parameterized\nhorseshoe electron velocity distributions. The velocity distribution function\nwas modeled to closely fit the electron distribution functions observed in the\nauroral cavity. We systematically varied the model parameters as well as the\npropagation direction to study the dependence of growth rates on model\nparameters. The growth rate depends strongly on loss cone opening angle, which\nmust be less than $90^{o}$ for significant CMI growth. The growth rate is\nsharply peaked for perpendicular radiation ($k_{\\parallel} = 0$), with a\nfull-width at half-maximum $1.7^{o}$, in good agreement with observed k-vector\norientations and numerical simulations. The fractional bandwidth varied between\n10$^{-4}$ and 10$^{-2}$, depending most strongly on propagation direction. This\nrange encompasses nearly all observed fractional AKR burst bandwidths. We find\nexcellent agreement between the computed RX mode emergent intensities and\nobserved AKR intensities assuming convective growth length $L_c\\approx$20-40 km\nand group speed 0.15$c$. The only computed LO mode growth rates compatible\nobserved LO mode radiation levels occurred for number densities more than 100\ntimes the average energetic electron densities measured in auroral cavities.\nThis implies that LO mode radiation is not produced directly by the CMI\nmechanism but more likely results from mode conversion of RX mode radiation. We\nfind that perturbation of the model velocity distribution by large ion solitary\nwaves (ion holes) can enhance the growth rate by a factor of 2-4.

176	0705.0879	Spin transport in magnetic multilayers	2007-05-07	\N	\N	  We study by extensive Monte Carlo simulations the transport of itinerant\nspins travelling inside a multilayer composed of three ferromagnetic films\nantiferromagnetically coupled to each other in a sandwich structure. The two\nexterior films interact with the middle one through non magnetic spacers. The\nspin model is the Ising one and the in-plane transport is considered. Various\ninteractions are taken into account. We show that the current of the itinerant\nspins going through this system depends strongly on the magnetic ordering of\nthe multilayer: at temperatures $T$ below (above) the transition temperature\n$T_c$, a strong (weak) current is observed. This results in a strong jump of\nthe resistance across $T_c$. Moreover, we observe an anomalous variation,\nnamely a peak, of the spin current in the critical region just above $T_c$. We\nshow that this peak is due to the formation of domains in the temperature\nregion between the low-$T$ ordered phase and the true paramagnetic disordered\nphase. The existence of such domains is known in the theory of critical\nphenomena. The behavior of the resistance obtained here is compared to a recent\nexperiment. An excellent agreement with our physical interpretation is\nobserved. We also show and discuss effects of various physical parameters\nentering our model such as interaction range, strength of electric and magnetic\nfields and magnetic film and non magnetic spacer thicknesses.\n	10.1088/0953-8984/19/35/356204	cond-mat.stat-mech	8 pages, 17 figures, submitted to J.

177	0705.0911	Composite lacunary polynomials and the proof of a conjecture of Schinzel	2007-05-07	\N	\N	  Let $g(x)$ be a fixed non-constant complex polynomial. It was conjectured by\nSchinzel that if $g(h(x))$ has boundedly many terms, then $h(x)\\in \\C[x]$ must\nalso have boundedly many terms. Solving an older conjecture raised by R\\'enyi\nand by Erd\\"os, Schinzel had proved this in the special cases $g(x)=x^d$;\nhowever that method does not extend to the general case. Here we prove the full\nSchinzel's conjecture (actually in sharper form) by a completely different\nmethod. Simultaneously we establish an "algorithmic" parametric description of\nthe general decomposition $f(x)=g(h(x))$, where $f$ is a polynomial with a\ngiven number of terms and $g,h$ are arbitrary polynomials. As a corollary, this\nimplies for instance that a polynomial with $l$ terms and given coefficients is\nnon-trivially decomposable if and only if the degree-vector lies in the union\nof certain finitely many subgroups of $\\Z^l$.\n	10.1007/s00222-008-0136-8	math.NT	9 pages

Theor. 40 (2007) 14499-513	  Open questions from Sarovar and Milburn (2006 J.Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 8487)\nare answered. Sarovar and Milburn derived a convenient upper bound for the\nFisher information of a one-parameter quantum channel. They showed that for\nquasi-classical models their bound is achievable and they gave a necessary and\nsufficient condition for positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) attaining\nthis bound. They asked (i) whether their bound is attainable more generally,\n(ii) whether explicit expressions for optimal POVMs can be derived from the\nattainability condition. We show that the symmetric logarithmic derivative\n(SLD) quantum information is less than or equal to the SM bound, i.e.\\\n$H(\\theta) \\leq C_{\\Upsilon}(\\theta)$ and we find conditions for equality. As\nthe Fisher information is less than or equal to the SLD quantum information,\ni.e. $F_M(\\theta) \\leq H(\\theta)$, we can deduce when equality holds in\n$F_M(\\theta) \\leq C_{\\Upsilon}(\\theta)$. Equality does not hold for all\nchannels. As a consequence, the attainability condition cannot be used to test\nfor optimal POVMs for all channels. These results are extended to\nmulti-parameter channels.\n	10.1088/1751-8113/40/48/013	quant-ph	16 pages. Published version. Some of the lemmas have been corrected.\n  New resuts have been added.

Geom., 3, 261-287, 2009	  We study the interplay between noncommutative tori and noncommutative\nelliptic curves through a category of equivariant differential modules on\n$\\mathbb{C}^*$. We functorially relate this category to the category of\nholomorphic vector bundles on noncommutative tori as introduced by Polishchuk\nand Schwarz and study the induced map between the corresponding K-theories. In\naddition, there is a forgetful functor to the category of noncommutative\nelliptic curves of Soibelman and Vologodsky, as well as a forgetful functor to\nthe category of vector bundles on $\\mathbb{C}^*$ with regular singular\nconnections.\n  The category that we consider has the nice property of being a Tannakian\ncategory, hence it is equivalent to the category of representations of an\naffine group scheme. Via an equivariant version of the Riemann-Hilbert\ncorrespondence we determine this group scheme to be (the algebraic hull of)\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2$. We also obtain a full subcategory of the category of\nholomorphic bundles of the noncommutative torus, which is equivalent to the\ncategory of representations of $\\mathbb{Z}$.

181	0705.1145	Lyman Break Galaxies at z~5: Rest-frame UV Spectra II	2007-05-08	\N	\N	  We present the results of spectroscopy of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z~5\nin the J0053+1234 field with the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph on the\nSubaru telescope. Among 5 bright candidates with z' < 25.0 mag, 2 objects are\nconfirmed to be at z~5 from their Ly alpha emission and the continuum\ndepression shortward of Ly alpha. The EWs of Ly alpha emission of the 2 LBGs\nare not so strong to be detected as Ly alpha emitters, and one of them shows\nstrong low-ionized interstellar (LIS) metal absorption lines. Two faint objects\nwith z' \\geq 25.0 mag are also confirmed to be at z~5, and their spectra show\nstrong Ly alpha emission in contrast to the bright ones. These results suggest\na deficiency of strong Ly alpha emission in bright LBGs at z~5, which has been\ndiscussed in our previous paper. Combined with our previous spectra of LBGs at\nz~5 obtained around the Hubble Deep Field-North (HDF-N), we made a composite\nspectrum of UV luminous (M_1400 \\leq -21.5 mag) LBGs at z~5. The resultant\nspectrum shows a weak Ly alpha emission and strong LIS absorptions which\nsuggests that the bright LBGs at z~5 have chemically evolved at least to ~0.1\nsolar metallicity. For a part of our sample in the HDF-N region, we obtained\nnear-to-mid infrared data, which constraint stellar masses of these objects.\nWith the stellar mass and the metallicity estimated from LIS absorptions, the\nmetallicities of the LBGs at z~5 tend to be lower than those of the galaxies\nwith the same stellar mass at z \\lesssim 2, although the uncertainty is very\nlarge.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.4.717	astro-ph	17 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ
182	0705.1185	Observation of Landau levels of Dirac fermions in graphite	2007-05-08	\N	Nature Physics, 3, 623 (2007)	  The low energy electronic excitations in single layer and bilayer graphite\n(graphene) resemble quantum-relativistic particles also known as Dirac Fermions\n(DF). They possess an internal degree of freedom, chirality, that leads to\nunusual Landau Level (LL) energy sequences in a magnetic field and profoundly\nalters the magneto-transport properties. One of the consequences is an\nanomalous Quantum-Hall effect, recently detected in both single layer and\nbi-layer graphene. However the underlying cause, the unusual LL sequence, was\nnever observed. Here we report the direct observation of LL of DF by means of\nlow temperature Scanning-Tunnelling-Spectroscopy (STS) on the surface of\ngraphite in fields up to 12 Tesla. We find evidence of coexistence of massless\nand massive DF, and identify the zero-energy LL which is a unique consequence\nof their quantum-relativistic nature. Surprisingly these strictly\ntwo-dimensional properties emerge even on bulk graphite in samples where the\ninterlayer coupling is weak.\n	10.1038/nphys653	cond-mat.mes-hall	14 pages, 4 figures. to appear in Nature Physics

Testing different line-number evolution\n  models via the cosmic flux decrement	2007-05-09	2007-11-09	\N	  [Abridged] We test the accuracy of different models of the attenuation of\nlight due to resonant scattering by intergalactic neutral hydrogen by comparing\ntheir predictions of the evolution of the mean cosmic flux decrement, D_A, to\nmeasurements of this quantity based on observations. To this end, we use data\navailable in the literature and our own measurements of the cosmic flux\ndecrement for 25 quasars in the redshift range 2.71 < z < 5.41 taken from the\nSDSS Data Release 5. In order to perform the measurements of D_A, we fit a\npower-law to the continuum redward of the Lya emission line, and extrapolate\nthis fit to region blueward of it, where the flux is severely affected by\nabsorption due to intervening HI absorbers. We compute, using numerical\nsimulations, the redshift evolution of D_A accounting for the presence of Lya\nForest absorbers and Lyman limit systems randomly distributed along the\nline-of-sight, and compute its intrinsic scatter at the 1-, 2-, and 3-sigma\nlevel due to fluctuations in the absorber properties (column density, Doppler\nparameter, redshift) along different lines-of-sight. The numerical simulations\nconsist of Monte Carlo realizations of distributions of the absorber properties\nconstrained from observations. The results from the models considered here\nconfirm our theoretical expectation that the distribution of D_A at any given\nredshift be well described by a lognormal distribution function. This implies\nthat the effective optical depth, usually defined as the negative logarithm of\nthe average flux, 1 - D_A, is very accurately Gaussian distributed, in contrast\nto previous studies. This result is independent to the form of the input\ndistribution functions, and rather insensitive to the presence of high-column\ndensity absorbers, such as the Lyman limit systems.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12691.x	astro-ph	Accepted by MNRAS.

184	0705.1325	Planetary embryos and planetesimals residing in thin debris disks	2007-05-09	\N	2007, MNRAS, 380, 1642	  We consider constraints on the planetesimal population residing in the disks\nof AU Microscopii, Beta Pictoris and Fomalhaut taking into account their\nobserved thicknesses and normal disk opacities. We estimate that bodies of\nradius 5, 180 and 70 km are responsible for initiating the collisional cascade\naccounting for the dust production for AU-Mic, Beta-Pic and Fomalhaut's disks,\nrespectively, at break radii from the star where their surface brightness\nprofiles change slope. Larger bodies, of radius 1000km and with surface density\nof order 0.01 g/cm^2, are required to explain the thickness of these disks\nassuming that they are heated by gravitational stirring. A comparison between\nthe densities of the two sizes suggests the size distribution in the largest\nbodies is flatter than that observed in the Kuiper belt.

185	0705.1365	Multi-wavelength analysis of 18um-selected galaxies in the AKARI/IRC\n  monitor field towards the North Ecliptic Pole	2007-05-09	\N	\N	  We present an initial analysis of AKARI 18um-selected galaxies using all 9\nphotometric bands at 2-24um available in the InfraRed Camera (IRC), in order to\ndemonstrate new capabilities of AKARI cosmological surveys. We detected 72\nsources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the AKARI/IRC monitor field\ntowards the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). From this sample, 25 galaxies with\nprobable redshifts z>~ 0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (N2-N3>0.1)\nfor a detailed SED analysis with ground-based BVRi'z'JK data. Using an SED\nradiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV --\nsubmm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of\n18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRC\nall-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blue\nside of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-band\nphotometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies,\nspecifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, we\nfind that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is\nrecognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z~1. By using such a colour\nanomaly due to the PAH and silicate absorption features, unique samples of\nULIRGs at z~1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from large\ncosmological surveys of AKARI towards the NEP, i.e. the NEP-Deep and NEP-Wide\nsurvey. This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interesting\ngalaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematic\ndifference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of the\nPAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts.

The data set\ncovers 6 wavelength bands from 2.5 to 11 $\\mu$m, with the exposure time of 10 ~\n20 minutes. This field lies within the CFHT survey with four filter bands ($g',\nr', i',z'), enabling us to establish nearly continuous spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) for wavelengths ranging from 0.4 to 11 $\\mu$m. The main\nsample studied here consists of 71 sources whose 11 $\\mu$m AB magnitudes are\nequal to or brighter than 18.5 (251 $\\mu$Jy), which is complete to more than\n90%. The 11 $\\mu$m band has an advantage of sampling star forming galaxies with\nlow to medium redshifts since the prominent PAH feature shifts into this band.\nAs expected, we find that the majority (~68%) of 11 $\\mu$m bright sources are\nstar forming galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.7 with $L_{IR} ~ 10^{10}$ -- $10^{12}\nL_{\\odot}$ based on the detailed modelling of SEDs. We also find four AGNs\nlying at various redshifts in the main sample. In addition, we discuss a few\nsources which have non-typical SEDs of the main sample, including a brown dwarf\ncandidate, a steep power-law source, flat spectrum object, and an early-type\ngalaxy at moderate redshift.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp2.S529	astro-ph	22 pages, 10 figures
187	0705.1428	Path Integral Methods in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Polaron Problem	2007-05-10	\N	\N	  I propose a path integral description of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\nHamiltonian, both in one and two dimensions, after mapping the real space model\nonto the time scale. While the lattice degrees of freedom are classical\nfunctions of time and are integrated out exactly, the electron particle paths\nare treated quantum mechanically. The method accounts for the variable range of\nthe electronic hopping processes. The free energy of the system and its\ntemperature derivatives are computed by summing at any $T$ over the ensemble of\nrelevant particle paths which mainly contribute to the total partition\nfunction. In the low $T$ regime, the {\\it heat capacity over T} ratio shows un\nupturn peculiar to a glass-like behavior. This feature is more sizeable in the\nsquare lattice than in the linear chain as the overall hopping potential\ncontribution to the total action is larger in higher dimensionality. The\neffects of the electron-phonon anharmonic interactions on the phonon subsystem\nare studied by the path integral cumulant expansion method.\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-6348-0_6	cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.stat-mech stat.AP	to appear in "Polarons in Advanced Materials" ed.

188	0705.1526	A new model for the structure of the DACs and SACs regions in the Oe and\n  Be stellar atmospheres	2007-05-10	\N	\N	  In this paper we present a new mathematical model for the density regions\nwhere a specific spectral line and its SACs/DACs are created in the Oe and Be\nstellar atmospheres. In the calculations of final spectral line function we\nconsider that the main reasons of the line broadening are the rotation of the\ndensity regions creating the spectral line and its DACs/SACs, as well as the\nrandom motions of the ions. This line function is able to reproduce the\nspectral feature and it enables us to calculate some important physical\nparameters, such as the rotational, the radial and the random velocities, the\nFull Width at Half Maximum, the Gaussian deviation, the optical depth, the\ncolumn density and the absorbed or emitted energy. Additionally, we can\ncalculate the percentage of the contribution of the rotational velocity and the\nions' random motions of the DACs/SACs regions to the line broadening. Finally,\nwe present two tests and three short applications of the proposed model.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.4.827	astro-ph	9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ
189	0705.1548	Dimensionality and dynamics in the behavior of C. elegans	2007-05-11	2007-05-16	\N	  A major challenge in analyzing animal behavior is to discover some underlying\nsimplicity in complex motor actions. Here we show that the space of shapes\nadopted by the nematode C. elegans is surprisingly low dimensional, with just\nfour dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance, and we partially\nreconstruct "equations of motion" for the dynamics in this space. These\ndynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a\nrapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli.\nStimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can\ngenerate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the\nworm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively "steering" the\nworm in real time.\n	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000028	q-bio.OT	9 pages, 6 figures, minor corrections

These are loci of low energy excitations covering part of the fermi\nsurface, that suddenly appear above $T_c$ instead of the nodal quasiparticles.\nBased on a semiclassical theory, we argue that partial Fermi surfaces arise\nnaturally in a d-wave superconductor that is destroyed by thermal phase\nfluctuations. Specifically, we show that the electron spectral function\ndevelops a square root singularity at low frequencies for wave-vectors\npositioned on the bare Fermi surface. We predict a temperature dependence of\nthe arc length that can partially account for results of recent angle resolved\nphoto emission (ARPES) experiments.\n	10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.247001	cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el	Journal ref. added

Several on-going\nand/or future galaxy surveys aim at detecting and precisely determining the BAO\nscale so as to trace the expansion history of the universe. We consider\nnonlinear and redshift-space distortion effects on the shifts of the BAO scale\nin $k$-space using perturbation theory. The resulting shifts are indeed\nsensitive to different choices of the definition of the BAO scale, which needs\nto be kept in mind in the data analysis. We present a toy model to explain the\nphysical behavior of the shifts. We find that the BAO scale defined as in\nPercival et al. (2007) indeed shows very small shifts ($\\lesssim$ 1%) relative\nto the prediction in {\\it linear theory} in real space. The shifts can be\npredicted accurately for scales where the perturbation theory is reliable.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.6.1049	astro-ph	21 pages, 9 figures, references and supplementary sections added,\n  accepted for publication in PASJ

We\nshow that the instrument is able to reach its specified precision only for\nmedium and high spectral resolution modes, differential observables and bright\nobjects. For absolute observables, the current achievable accuracy is strongly\nlimited by the vibrations of the Unit Telescopes, and also by the observing\nprocedure which does not take into account the night-long transfer function\nmonitoring. For low-resolution mode, the current limitation is more in the data\nreduction side, since several effects negligible at medium spectral resolution\nare not taken into account in the current pipeline. Finally, for faint objects\n(SNR around 1 per spectral channel), electromagnetic interferences in the VLTI\ninterferometric laboratory with the detector electronics prevents currently to\nget unbiased measurements.

Recently, this discussion has focused on the number of\nenergy gaps in these materials. Some experiments indicate a single energy gap,\nimplying that the pseudogap is a precursor state. Others indicate two,\nsuggesting that it is a competing or coexisting phase. Here we report on\ntemperature dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy of Pb-Bi2Sr2CuO6+x. We\nhave found a new, narrow, homogeneous gap that vanishes near TC, superimposed\non the typically observed, inhomogeneous, broad gap, which is only weakly\ntemperature dependent.

For\nheavy Fermion (HF) compounds, however, the f electrons show both itinerant and\nlocalized behaviours depending on temperature. Above the characteristic\ntemperature T*, which is typically of the order of few K to few tens K, their\nmagnetic properties are well described by the ionic f-electron models,\nsuggesting that the f-electrons behave as 'localized' electrons. On the other\nhand, well below T*, their Fermi surfaces (FS's) have been observed by\nmagneto-oscillatory techniques, and generally they can be explained well by the\n'itinerant' f-electron model. These two models assume totally different natures\nof felectrons, and how they transform between localized and itinerant state as\na function of temperatures has never been understood on the level of their\nelectronic structures. Here we have studied the band structure of the HF\nantiferromagnetic superconductor UPd2Al3 well below and above T* by\nangle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), and revealed the temperature\ndependence of the electronic structure. We have found that the f-bands, which\nform the FS's at low temperatures are excluded from FS's at high temperatures.\nThe present results demonstrate how the same f-electrons show both itinerant\nand localized behaviours on the level of electronic structure, and provide an\nimportant information for the unified description of the localized and\nitinerant nature of HF compounds.\n	10.1038/nphys651	cond-mat.str-el	16 pages, 4 figures, the revised manuscript was accepted to Nature\n  Physics

For preventing\nthe untrustworthy server Alice from eavesdropping the quantum lines, a\nnonorthogonal-coding technique (decoy-photon technique) is used in the process\nthat the quantum signal is transmitted between the users. This protocol does\nnot require the servers and the users to store the quantum state and almost all\nof the single photons can be used for carrying the information, which makes it\nmore convenient for application than others with present technology. We also\ndiscuss the case with a faint laser pulse.\n	10.1088/0256-307X/23/11/004	quant-ph	4 pages, 1 figures. It also presented a way for preparing decoy\n  photons without a sinigle-photon source
198	0705.1825	The Correlation Between Star Formation and 21cm Emission During the\n  Reionization Epoch	2007-05-13	\N	\N	  Reionization is thought to be dominated by low mass galaxies, while direct\nobservations of resolved galaxies probe only the most massive, rarest objects.\nThe cross-correlation between fluctuations in the surface brightness of the\ncumulative Ly-alpha emission (which serves as a proxy for the star formation\nrate) and the redshifted 21cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM), will directly probe the causal link between the production of\nionizing photons in galaxies and the reionization of the IGM. We discuss the\nprospects for detecting this cross-correlation for unresolved galaxies. We find\nthat on angular scales <10 arc-minutes, detection will be practical using\nwidefield near-IR imaging from space in combination with the forthcoming\nMileura Widefield Array - Low Frequency Demonstrator. When redshifted 21cm\nobservations of the neutral IGM are combined with space-based near-IR imaging\nof Ly-alpha emission, the detection on angular scales <3 arc-minutes will be\nlimited by the sensitivity of the 21cm signal, even when a small aperture\noptical telescope (~2m) and a moderate field of view (~10 square degrees) are\nused. On scales >3 arc-minutes, the measurement of cross-correlation will be\nlimited by the accuracy of the foreground sky subtraction.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12149.x	astro-ph	12 pages. 5 figures.

All characteristic features of the temperature dependence of the\nresistivity can be quantitatively understood through this approach as\noriginating from the close vicinity of the metal-insulator transition. In\nparticular, we find that the magnetic field induced changes in resistance\ncannot be explained within a mean-field treatment of the magnetic state, and\nthat accounting for thermal fluctuations is crucial for a quantitative\nanalysis.

203	0705.2172	Dominant aerosol processes during high-pollution episodes over Greater\n  Tokyo	2007-05-15	\N	\N	  This paper studies two high-pollution episodes over Greater Tokyo: 9 and 10\nDecember 1999, and 31 July and 1 August 2001. Results obtained with the\nchemistry-transport model (CTM) Polair3D are compared to measurements of\ninorganic PM2.5. To understand to which extent the aerosol processes modeled in\nPolair3D impact simulated inorganic PM2.5, Polair3D is run with different\noptions in the aerosol module, e.g. with/without heterogeneous reactions. To\nquantify the impact of processes outside the aerosol module, simulations are\nalso done with another CTM (CMAQ). In the winter episode, sulfate is mostly\nimpacted by condensation, coagulation, long-range transport, and deposition to\na lesser extent. In the summer episode, the effect of long-range transport\nlargely dominates. The impact of condensation/evaporation is dominant for\nammonium, nitrate and chloride in both episodes. However, the impact of the\nthermodynamic equilibrium assumption is limited. The impact of heterogeneous\nreactions is large for nitrate and ammonium, and taking heterogeneous reactions\ninto account appears to be crucial in predicting the peaks of nitrate and\nammonium. The impact of deposition is the same for all inorganic PM2.5. It is\nsmall compared to the impact of other processes although it is not negligible.\nThe impact of nucleation is negligible in the summer episode, and small in the\nwinter episode. The impact of coagulation is larger in the winter episode than\nin the summer episode, because the number of small particles is higher in the\nwinter episode as a consequence of nucleation.\n	10.1029/2006JD007885	physics.ao-ph	Journal of Geophysical Research D: Atmospheres (15/05/2007) in press
204	0705.2180	Observation of Electron-Hole Puddles in Graphene Using a Scanning Single\n  Electron Transistor	2007-05-15	\N	\N	  The electronic density of states of graphene is equivalent to that of\nrelativistic electrons. In the absence of disorder or external doping the Fermi\nenergy lies at the Dirac point where the density of states vanishes. Although\ntransport measurements at high carrier densities indicate rather high\nmobilities, many questions pertaining to disorder remain unanswered. In\nparticular, it has been argued theoretically, that when the average carrier\ndensity is zero, the inescapable presence of disorder will lead to electron and\nhole puddles with equal probability. In this work, we use a scanning single\nelectron transistor to image the carrier density landscape of graphene in the\nvicinity of the neutrality point. Our results clearly show the electron-hole\npuddles expected theoretically. In addition, our measurement technique enables\nto determine locally the density of states in graphene. In contrast to\npreviously studied massive two dimensional electron systems, the kinetic\ncontribution to the density of states accounts quantitatively for the measured\nsignal. Our results suggests that exchange and correlation effects are either\nweak or have canceling contributions.\n	10.1038/nphys781	cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.str-el	13 pages, 5 figures

208	0705.2279	Quantum spin liquid states in the two dimensional kagome\n  antiferromagnets, ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2	2007-05-16	\N	\N	  A three-dimensional system of interacting spins typically develops static\nlong-range order when it is cooled. If the spins are quantum (S = 1/2),\nhowever, novel quantum paramagnetic states may appear. The most highly sought\nstate among them is the resonating valence bond (RVB) state in which every pair\nof neighboring quantum spins form entangled spin singlets (valence bonds) and\nthe singlets are quantum mechanically resonating amongst all the possible\nhighly degenerate pairing states. Here we provide experimental evidence for\nsuch quantum paramagnetic states existing in frustrated antiferromagnets,\nZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2, where the S = 1/2 magnetic Cu2+ moments form layers of a\ntwo-dimensional kagome lattice. We find that in Cu4(OD)6Cl2, where distorted\nkagome planes are weakly coupled to each other, a dispersionless excitation\nmode appears in the magnetic excitation spectrum below ~ 20 K, whose\ncharacteristics resemble those of quantum spin singlets in a solid state, known\nas a valence bond solid (VBS), that breaks translational symmetry. Doping\nnonmagnetic Zn2+ ions reduces the distortion of the kagome lattice, and weakens\nthe interplane coupling but also dilutes the magnetic occupancy of the kagome\nlattice. The VBS state is suppressed and for ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 where the kagome\nplanes are undistorted and 90% occupied by the Cu2+ ions, the low energy spin\nfluctuations in the spin liquid phase become featureless.\n	10.1038/nmat1986	cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mtrl-sci	\N

210	0705.2362	Geometric control theory I: mathematical foundations	2007-05-16	2015-05-15	\N	  A geometric setup for control theory is presented. The argument is developed\nthrough the study of the extremals of action functionals defined on piecewise\ndifferentiable curves, in the presence of differentiable non-holonomic\nconstraints. Special emphasis is put on the tensorial aspects of the theory. To\nstart with, the kinematical foundations, culminating in the so called\nvariational equation, are put on geometrical grounds, via the introduction of\nthe concept of infinitesimal control . On the same basis, the usual\nclassification of the extremals of a variational problem into normal and\nabnormal ones is also rationalized, showing the existence of a purely\nkinematical algorithm assigning to each admissible curve a corresponding\nabnormality index, defined in terms of a suitable linear map. The whole\nmachinery is then applied to constrained variational calculus. The argument\nprovides an interesting revisitation of Pontryagin maximum principle and of the\nErdmann-Weierstrass corner conditions, as well as a proof of the classical\nLagrange multipliers method and a local interpretation of Pontryagin's\nequations as dynamical equations for a free (singular) Hamiltonian system. As a\nfinal, highly non-trivial topic, a sufficient condition for the existence of\nfinite deformations with fixed endpoints is explicitly stated and proved.\n	\N	math.OC math-ph math.MP	replaced by the more recent article arXiv:1503.08808

213	0705.2392	Electro-optically tunable microring resonators in lithium niobate	2007-05-16	\N	\N	  Optical microresonators have recently attracted a growing attention in the\nphotonics community. Their applications range from quantum electro-dynamics to\nsensors and filtering devices for optical telecommunication systems, where they\nare likely to become an essential building block. The integration of nonlinear\nand electro-optical properties in the resonators represents a very stimulating\nchallenge, as it would incorporate new and more advanced functionality. Lithium\nniobate is an excellent candidate material, being an established choice for\nelectro-optic and nonlinear optical applications. Here we report on the first\nrealization of optical microring resonators in submicrometric thin films of\nlithium niobate. The high index contrast films are produced by an improved\ncrystal ion slicing and bonding technique using benzocyclobutene. The rings\nhave radius R=100 um and their transmission spectrum has been tuned using the\nelectro-optic effect.

The attenuation effect, which depends on the\ndistribution of mass elements into the Sun, was compared with the relativistic\neffect for the orbital elements of planets.

The effect of attenuation\nduring a solar eclipse will produce a local reduction in the soli-lunar\nattraction of 0.13 microgal. This small variation of gravity during the eclipse\ncan lead to distortions of the geoid of about ten millimetres of which effect\non gravity, estimated at a few microgals, is compatible with the observed\ngravitational anomalies.

Math., 72, no. 6 (2008), 1187-1252	  A generalization of the usual ideles group is proposed, namely, we construct\ncertain adelic complexes for sheaves of $K$-groups on schemes. More generally,\nsuch complexes are defined for any abelian sheaf on a scheme. We focus on the\ncase when the sheaf is associated to the presheaf of a homology theory with\ncertain natural axioms, satisfied by $K$-theory. In this case it is proven that\nthe adelic complex provides a flasque resolution for the above sheaf and that\nthe natural morphism to the Gersten complex is a quasiisomorphism. The main\nadvantage of the new adelic resolution is that it is contravariant and\nmultiplicative in contrast to the Gersten resolution. In particular, this\nallows to reprove that the intersection in Chow groups coincides up to sign\nwith the natural product in the corresponding $K$-cohomology groups. Also, we\nshow that the Weil pairing can be expressed as a Massey triple product in\n$K$-cohomology groups with certain indices.\n	10.1070/IM2008v072n06ABEH002433	math.AG math.KT	64 pages

The criteria of the\nsample selection were (1) RC3 morphological type in the range Sa to Scd, (2)\ndistance less than 25 Mpc, (3) inclination angle less than 79deg (RC3), (4)\nflux at 100 um higher than ~ 10 Jy, (5) spiral structure is not destroyed by\ninteraction. The maps of CO cover most of the optical disk of the galaxies. We\ninvestigated the influence of bar on the distribution of molecular gas in\nspiral galaxies using these data. We confirmed that the degree of central\nconcentration is higher in barred spirals than in non-barred spirals as shown\nby the previous works. Furthermore, we present an observational evidence that\nbars are efficient in driving molecular gas that lies within the bar length\ntoward the center, while the role in bringing gas in from the outer parts of\nthe disks is small. The transported gas accounts for about half of molecular\ngas within the central region in barred spiral galaxies. We found a correlation\nbetween the degree of central concentration and bar strength. Galaxies with\nstronger bars tend to have higher central concentration. The correlation\nimplies that stronger bars accumulate molecular gas toward the center more\nefficiently. These results are consistent with long-lived bars.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.1.117	astro-ph	15 pages, 50 figures, 3 tables

223	0705.2842	The design of a very high-Q superconductor electromechanical clock	2007-05-19	\N	\N	  We discuss theoretically the properties of an electromechanical oscillator\nwhose operation is based upon the cyclic, quasi-conservative conversion between\ngravitational potential, kinetic, and magnetic energies. The system consists of\na strong-pinning type-II superconductor square loop subjected to a constant\nexternal force and to magnetic fields. The loop oscillates in the upright\nposition at a frequency that can be tuned in the range 10-1000 Hz, and has\ninduced in it a rectified electrical current. The emphasis of this paper is on\nthe evaluation of the major remaining source of losses in the oscillations. We\nargue that such losses should be associated with the viscous vibration of\npinned flux lines in the superconductor Nb-Ti wire, provided the oscillator is\nkept close to zero Kelvin, under high-vacuum, and the magnetic field is\nsufficiently uniform. We discuss how other different sources of loss would\nbecome negligible for such operational conditions, so that a very high quality\nfactor Q exceeding 10^(10) might in principle be reached by the oscillator. The\nprospective utilization of such oscillator as a low-frequency high-Q clock is\nanalyzed.\n	10.1590/S0103-97332007000300013	cond-mat.supr-con	to be published in the Brazilian Journal of Physics

This\ncomputer code allows to calculate, by using Monte Carlo simulations, the\nevolution of a large ensemble of binary systems, with proper accounting for the\nspin evolution of magnetized neutron stars.\n  We show that the XLF has no universal type. It depends on the star formation\nrate in the galaxy. Also it is of importance to take into account the evolution\nof binary systems and life times of X-ray stages in theoretical models of such\nfunctions. We have calculated cumulative and differential XLFs for the galaxy\nwith the constant star formation rate. Also we have calculated cumulative\nluminosity functions for different intervals of time after the star formation\nburst in the galaxy and curves depicting the evolution of the X-ray luminosity\nafter the star formation burst in the galaxy.\n	10.1134/S1063772908040045	astro-ph	22 pages, 13 figures
225	0705.2871	On spectral properties of translationally invariant magnetic\n  Schr\\"odinger operators	2007-05-20	\N	\N	  We consider a class of translationally invariant magnetic fields such that\nthe corresponding potential has a constant direction.\n  Our goal is to study basic spectral properties of the Schr\\"odinger operator\n${\\bf H}$ with such a potential. In particular, we show that the spectrum of\n${\\bf H}$ is absolutely continuous and we find its location. Then we study the\nlong-time behaviour of solutions $\\exp(-i {\\bf H} t)f$ of the time dependent\nSchr\\"odinger equation. It turnes out that a quantum particle remains localized\nin the plane orthogonal to the direction of the potential. Its propagation in\nthis direction is determined by group velocities. It is to a some extent\nsimilar to a evolution of a one-dimensional free particle but "exits" to\n$+\\infty$ and $-\\infty$ might be essentially different.\n	10.1007/s00023-007-0354-4	math.SP math-ph math.MP	\N

228	0705.3025	Spectral Efficiency of Spectrum Pooling Systems	2007-05-21	2010-04-02	IET Special Issue on Cognitive Spectrum Access, Vol. 2, No. 6, pp.\n  733-741, July 2008	  In this contribution, we investigate the idea of using cognitive radio to\nreuse locally unused spectrum to increase the total system capacity. We\nconsider a multiband/wideband system in which the primary and cognitive users\nwish to communicate to different receivers, subject to mutual interference and\nassume that each user knows only his channel and the unused spectrum through\nadequate sensing. The basic idea under the proposed scheme is based on the\nnotion of spectrum pooling. The idea is quite simple: a cognitive radio will\nlisten to the channel and, if sensed idle, will transmit during the voids. It\nturns out that, although its simplicity, the proposed scheme showed very\ninteresting features with respect to the spectral efficiency and the maximum\nnumber of possible pairwise cognitive communications. We impose the constraint\nthat users successively transmit over available bands through selfish water\nfilling. For the first time, our study has quantified the asymptotic (with\nrespect to the band) achievable gain of using spectrum pooling in terms of\nspectral efficiency compared to classical radio systems. We then derive the\ntotal spectral efficiency as well as the maximum number of possible pairwise\ncommunications of such a spectrum pooling system.\n	\N	cs.IT cs.NI math.IT	24 pages, 8 figures

229	0705.3068	Gate Electrostatics and Quantum Capacitance of Graphene Nanoribbons	2007-05-22	\N	\N	  Capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics are important for understanding\nfundamental electronic structures and device applications of nanomaterials. The\nC-V characteristics of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are examined using\nself-consistent atomistic simulations. The results indicate strong dependence\nof the GNR C-V characteristics on the edge shape. For zigzag edge GNRs, highly\nnon-uniform charge distribution in the transverse direction due to edge states\nlowers the gate capacitance considerably, and the self-consistent electrostatic\npotential significantly alters the band structure and carrier velocity. For an\narmchair edge GNR, the quantum capacitance is a factor of 2 smaller than its\ncorresponding zigzag carbon nanotube, and a multiple gate geometry is less\nbeneficial for transistor applications.

A 75, 062107 (2007)	  One and two photon wave functions are derived by projecting the quantum state\nvector onto simultaneous eigenvectors of the number operator and a recently\nconstructed photon position operator [Phys. Rev A 59, 954 (1999)] that couples\nspin and orbital angular momentum. While only the Landau-Peierls wave function\ndefines a positive definite photon density, a similarity transformation to a\nbiorthogonal field-potential pair of positive frequency solutions of Maxwell's\nequations preserves eigenvalues and expectation values. We show that this real\nspace description of photons is compatible with all of the usual rules of\nquantum mechanics and provides a framework for understanding the relationships\namongst different forms of the photon wave function in the literature. It also\ngives a quantum picture of the optical angular momentum of beams that applies\nto both one photon and coherent states.

233	0705.3300	Observational Characteristics of the First Protostellar Cores	2007-05-23	\N	\N	  First protostellar cores are young stellar objects in the earliest\nevolutionary stage. They are hydrostatic objects formed soon after the central\nportions of star-forming cores become optically thick to dust emission. We\nconsider their characteristics in the emitted radiation, and discuss their\nevolution with increasing mass of the cores. Particular attention is paid to\ndetailed radiative and chemical processes in the postshock relaxation layer\nlocated at the surface of the core, where the majority of radiation is emitted.\nMost of the radiation is originally emitted in the dust continuum in\nmid-infrared wavelength (~10-30 micron), which reprocessed to far-infrared with\n~100-200 micron. Although some fraction (~0.1) of the radiation energy is\nemitted in the H2O lines at the accretion shock, most is absorbed and reemitted\nin the dust continuum in the envelope. The H2O lines account for at most ~1/100\nof the observed luminosity. If a cavity is present in the envelope due to\noutflow or rotation, the dust and H2O line emission in the mid-infrared\nwavelength from the shock can be observed directly, or as a reflection nebula.\nAmong forthcoming observational facillities, SPICA is the most suitable for\ndetecting either direct or processed radiation from first-core objects.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.3.589	astro-ph	To appear in PASJ vol.59

237	0705.3417	A discussion on particle number and quantum indistinguishability	2007-05-23	\N	Foundations of Physics 37 (2007) 855-878	  The concept of individuality in quantum mechanics shows radical differences\nfrom the concept of individuality in classical physics, as E. Schroedinger\npointed out in the early steps of the theory. Regarding this fact, some authors\nsuggested that quantum mechanics does not possess its own language, and\ntherefore, quantum indistinguishability is not incorporated in the theory from\nthe beginning. Nevertheless, it is possible to represent the idea of quantum\nindistinguishability with a first order language using quasiset theory (Q). In\nthis work, we show that Q cannot capture one of the most important features of\nquantum non individuality, which is the fact that there are quantum systems for\nwhich particle number is not well defined. An axiomatic variant of Q, in which\nquasicardinal is not a primitive concept (for a kind of quasisets called finite\nquasisets), is also given. This result encourages the searching of theories in\nwhich the quasicardinal, being a secondary concept, stands undefined for some\nquasisets, besides showing explicitly that in a set theory about collections of\ntruly indistinguishable entities, the quasicardinal needs not necessarily be a\nprimitive concept.\n	10.1007/s10701-007-9129-5	quant-ph	46 pages, no figures.

We first\ncharacterize stationary menisci and their breakdown at the coating transition.\nIt is then shown that the dynamics of both liquid deposition and\nlong-wavelength perturbations adiabatically follow these stationary states.\nThis provides a first experimental access to the entire bifurcation diagram of\ndynamical wetting, confirming the hydrodynamic theory developed in Part 1. In\ncontrast to quasi-static theories based on a dynamic contact angle, we\ndemonstrate that the transition strongly depends on the large scale flow\ngeometry. We then establish the dispersion relation for large wavenumbers, for\nwhich we find that sigma is linear in q. The speed dependence of sigma is well\ndescribed by hydrodynamic theory, in particular the absence of diverging\ntime-scales at the critical point. Finally, we highlight some open problems\nrelated to contact angle hysteresis that lead beyond the current description.\n	10.1017/S0022112008000979	physics.flu-dyn	20 pages, 11 figures Part 1 is stored as Arxiv 0705.3576

244	0705.3869	A first-principles model of early evolution: Emergence of gene families,\n  species and preferred protein folds	2007-05-25	\N	\N	  In this work we develop a microscopic physical model of early evolution,\nwhere phenotype,organism life expectancy, is directly related to genotype, the\nstability of its proteins in their native conformations which can be determined\nexactly in the model. Simulating the model on a computer, we consistently\nobserve the Big Bang scenario whereby exponential population growth ensues as\nsoon as favorable sequence-structure combinations (precursors of stable\nproteins) are discovered. Upon that, random diversity of the structural space\nabruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that\nprotein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at time scales much\ngreater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the\nlifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law.\nThe separation of evolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and\ngeneration of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and\nsuperfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same\ndistributions for real proteins. On the population level we observe emergence\nof species, subpopulations which carry similar genomes. Further we present a\nsimple theory that relates stability of evolving proteins to the sizes of\nemerging genomes. Together, these results provide a microscopic first\nprinciples picture of how first gene families developed in the course of early\nevolution\n	10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030139	q-bio.BM q-bio.PE	In press, PLoS Computational Biology

250	0705.3957	Visualizing the geometry of state space in plane Couette flow	2007-05-27	2008-02-11	\N	  Motivated by recent experimental and numerical studies of coherent structures\nin wall-bounded shear flows, we initiate a systematic exploration of the\nhierarchy of unstable invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. We\nconstruct a dynamical, 10^5-dimensional state-space representation of plane\nCouette flow at Re = 400 in a small, periodic cell and offer a new method of\nvisualizing invariant manifolds embedded in such high dimensions. We compute a\nnew equilibrium solution of plane Couette flow and the leading eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions of known equilibria at this Reynolds number and cell size. What\nemerges from global continuations of their unstable manifolds is a surprisingly\nelegant dynamical-systems visualization of moderate-Reynolds turbulence. The\ninvariant manifolds tessellate the region of state space explored by\ntransiently turbulent dynamics with a rigid web of continuous and discrete\nsymmetry-induced heteroclinic connections.\n	10.1017/S002211200800267X	physics.flu-dyn math.DS	32 pages, 13 figures submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics

It is\nobtained by applying non-uniform O(2) rotations of spin operators in the XY\nplane on the SU(2)-invariant Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) states and\ntheir parent Hamiltonians. Excitation energies of the new ground states are\nstudied with the use of single-mode approximation in one dimension for S=1. The\nexcitation gap remains robust. Construction of chiral AKLT states is shown to\nbe possible in higher dimensions. We also present a general idea to produce\nvector chirality-condensed ground states as non-uniform O(2) rotations of the\nnon-chiral parent states. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is shown to imply\nnon-zero spin chirality.\n	10.3938/jkps.53.732	cond-mat.str-el	4 pages, 1 figure
256	0705.4139	Our Peculiar Motion Away from the Local Void	2007-05-28	2007-12-13	Astrophys.J.676:184-205,2008	  The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant\ncomponents. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on\ndistinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their\ninfluences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at\n~7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet\nthat bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our\nGalaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local\nVoid. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the\nVirgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest\ncomponent is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered near\nthe direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components\nare 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s in\nthe reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into\naccount causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed\nconcentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion\nattributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our\nLocal Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo\nSpur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with\nour filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local\nVoid reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away from\nthe void center. Given the velocities expected from gravitational instability\ntheory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the\nLocal Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position.

257	0705.4144	The Infrared Camera (IRC) for AKARI - Design and Imaging Performance	2007-05-29	\N	\N	  The Infrared Camera (IRC) is one of two focal-plane instruments on the AKARI\nsatellite. It is designed for wide-field deep imaging and low-resolution\nspectroscopy in the near- to mid-infrared (1.8--26.5um) in the pointed\nobservation mode of AKARI. IRC is also operated in the survey mode to make an\nall-sky survey at 9 and 18um. It comprises three channels. The NIR channel\n(1.8--5.5um) employs a 512 x 412 InSb array, whereas both the MIR-S\n(4.6--13.4um) and MIR-L (12.6--26.5um) channels use 256 x 256 Si:As impurity\nband conduction arrays. Each of the three channels has a field-of-view of about\n10' x 10' and are operated simultaneously. The NIR and MIR-S share the same\nfield-of-view by virtue of a beam splitter. The MIR-L observes the sky about\n$25' away from the NIR/MIR-S field-of-view. IRC gives us deep insights into the\nformation and evolution of galaxies, the evolution of planetary disks, the\nprocess of star-formation, the properties of interstellar matter under various\nphysical conditions, and the nature and evolution of solar system objects. The\nin-flight performance of IRC has been confirmed to be in agreement with the\npre-flight expectation.

More precisely we\nfirst obtain a UDF for Lie subgroups acting on a symplectic symmetric space M\nin a locally simply transitive manner. Then, observing that a curvature\ncontraction canonically relates anti de Sitter geometry to the geometry of\nsymplectic symmetric spaces, we use that UDF to define what we call\nDirac-isospectral noncommutative deformations of the spectral triples of\nlocally anti de Sitter black holes.

E 77, 021802 (2008)	  In this work the dynamics of a freely jointed random chain which fluctuates\nat constant temperature in some viscous medium is studied. The chain is\nregarded as a system of small particles which perform a brownian motion and are\nsubjected to rigid constraints which forbid the breaking of the chain. For\nsimplicity, all interactions among the particles have been switched off and the\nnumber of dimensions has been limited to two. The problem of describing the\nfluctuations of the chain in the limit in which it becomes a continuous system\nis solved using a path integral approach, in which the constraints are imposed\nwith the insertion in the path integral of suitable Dirac delta functions. It\nis shown that the probability distribution of the possible conformations in\nwhich the fluctuating chain can be found during its evolution in time coincides\nwith the partition function of a field theory which is a generalization of the\nnonlinear sigma model in two dimensions. Both the probability distribution and\nthe generating functional of the correlation functions of the positions of the\nbeads are computed explicitly in a semiclassical approximation for a\nring-shaped chain.\n	10.1103/PhysRevE.77.021802	cond-mat.stat-mech	36 pages, 2 figures, LaTeX + REVTeX4 + graphicx, minor changes in the\n  text, reference added
260	0705.4207	Measurement of the Spin-Transfer-Torque Vector in Magnetic Tunnel\n  Junctions	2007-05-29	\N	\N	  Spin-polarized currents can transfer spin angular momentum to a ferromagnet,\ngenerating a torque that can efficiently reorient its magnetization. Achieving\nquantitative measurements of the spin-transfer-torque vector in magnetic tunnel\njunctions (MTJs) is important for understanding fundamental mechanisms\naffecting spin-dependent tunneling, and for developing magnetic memories and\nnanoscale microwave oscillators. Here we present direct measurements of both\nthe magnitude and direction of the spin torque in Co60Fe20B20/MgO/Co60Fe20B20\nMTJs. At low bias V, the differential torque vector d{tau}/dV lies in the plane\ndefined by the electrode magnetizations, and its magnitude is in excellent\nagreement with a prediction for highly-spin-polarized tunneling. With\nincreasing bias, the in-plane component d{tau}_{parallel}/dV remains large, in\nstriking contrast to the decreasing magnetoresistance ratio. The differential\ntorque vector also rotates out of the plane under bias; we measure a\nperpendicular component tau_{perp}(V) with bias dependence proportional to V^2\nfor low V, that becomes as large as 30% of the in-plane torque.\n	10.1038/nphys783	cond-mat.other	33 pages, 9 figures

Such a beam can be used to probe new effects beyond standard\nmodel. We mean here new tests concerning CP violation, Lorentz structure and\nchirality structure of the charged current weak interactions. The main goal is\nto show how the energy and angular distribution of the electron antineutrinos\nin the muon rest frame depends on the transverse components of the antineutrino\nbeam polarization. Our analysis is model-independent and consistent with the\ncurrent upper limits on the non-standard couplings.

A duality property about this mechanism\nindicates that there exist eight possible Higgs triplet Yukawa couplings which\nresult in the same neutrino mass matrix. In this paper, We work out the\none-loop renormalization group equations for the effective neutrino mass matrix\nin the supersymmetric left-right model. The stability of the Type-II seesaw\nscenario is briefly discussed. We also study the lepton-flavor-violating\nprocesses ($\\tau\\to \\mu\\gamma$ and $\\tau\\to e\\gamma$) by using the\nreconstructed Higgs triplet Yukawa couplings.\n	10.1088/1674-1137/35/3/002	hep-ph	\N
264	0705.4371	Stable simulation of fluid flow with high-Reynolds number using\n  Ehrenfests' steps	2007-05-30	\N	\N	  The Navier--Stokes equations arise naturally as a result of Ehrenfests'\ncoarse-graining in phase space after a period of free-flight dynamics. This\npoint of view allows for a very flexible approach to the simulation of fluid\nflow for high-Reynolds number. We construct regularisers for lattice Boltzmann\ncomputational models. These regularisers are based on Ehrenfests'\ncoarse-graining idea and could be applied to schemes with either entropic or\nnon-entropic quasiequilibria. We give a numerical scheme which gives good\nresults for the standard test cases of the shock tube and the flow past a\nsquare cylinder.\n	10.1007/s11075-007-9087-1	cond-mat.stat-mech	21 pages, 2 figures

Matter 22 (2010) 236001	  Finite-temperature micromagnetics simulations are employed to study the\nmagnetization-switching dynamics driven by a field applied at an angle to the\nlong axis of an iron nanopillar. A bi-modal distribution in the switching times\nis observed, and evidence for two competing modes of magnetization-switching\ndynamics is presented. For the conditions studied here, temperature $T = 20$ K\nand the reversal field 3160 Oe at an angle of 75$^\\circ$ to the long axis,\napproximately 70% of the switches involve unstable decay (no free-energy\nbarrier) and 30% involve metastable decay (a free-energy barrier is crossed).\nThe latter are indistinguishable from switches which are constrained to start\nat a metastable free-energy minimum. Competition between unstable and\nmetastable decay could greatly complicate applications involving magnetization\nswitches near the coercive field.\n	10.1088/0953-8984/22/23/236001	cond-mat.stat-mech	19 pages, 7 figures
266	0705.4469	Weather in stellar atmosphere: the dynamics of mercury clouds in alpha\n  Andromedae	2007-05-30	\N	\N	  The formation of long-lasting structures at the surfaces of stars is commonly\nascribed to the action of strong magnetic fields. This paradigm is supported by\nobservations of evolving cool spots in the Sun and active late-type stars, and\nstationary chemical spots in the early-type magnetic stars. However, results of\nour seven-year monitoring of mercury spots in non-magnetic early-type star\nalpha Andromedae show that the picture of magnetically-driven structure\nformation is fundamentally incomplete. Using an indirect stellar surface\nmapping technique, we construct a series of 2-D images of starspots and\ndiscover a secular evolution of the mercury cloud cover in this star. This\nremarkable structure formation process, observed for the first time in any\nstar, is plausibly attributed to a non-equilibrium, dynamical evolution of the\nheavy-element clouds created by atomic diffusion and may have the same\nunderlying physics as the weather patterns on terrestrial and giant planets.\n	10.1038/nphys648	astro-ph	10 pages, 2 figures; to be published in Nature Physics

One device had a single-turn Al loop,\nthe second had a 6-turn Nb loop, and the third was a first order gradiometer\nformed from 6-turn wound and counter-wound Nb coils to provide isolation from\nspatially uniform flux noise. In the 6 - 7.2 GHz range, the spectroscopic\ncoherence times for the gradiometer varied from 4 ns to 8 ns, about the same as\nfor the other devices (4 to 10 ns). The time constant for decay of Rabi\noscillations was significantly longer in the single-turn Al device (20 to 30\nns) than either of the Nb devices (10 to 15 ns). These results imply that\nspatially uniform flux noise is not the main source of decoherence or\ninhomogenous broadening in these devices.\n	10.1109/TASC.2007.898124	cond-mat.supr-con	4 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Trans.

268	0705.4586	The magnetic fields of large Virgo Cluster spirals	2007-05-31	\N	\N	  Because of its proximity the Virgo Cluster is an excellent target for\nstudying interactions of galaxies with the cluster environment. Both the\nhigh-velocity tidal interactions and effects of ram pressure stripping by the\nintracluster gas can be investigated. Optical and/or \\ion{H}{i} observations do\nnot always show effects of weak interactions between galaxies and their\nencounters with the cluster medium. For this reason we searched for possible\nanomalies in the magnetic field structure in Virgo Cluster spirals which could\nbe attributed to perturbations in their gas distribution and kinematics. Five\nangularly large Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies (NGC 4501, NGC 4438, NGC 4535,\nNGC 4548 and NGC 4654) were the targets for a sensitive total power and\npolarization study using the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg at 4.85 GHz.\nFor two objects polarization data at higher frequencies have been obtained\nallowing Faraday rotation analysis. Distorted magnetic field structures were\nidentified in all galaxies. Interaction-induced magnetized outflows were found\nin NGC 4438 (due to nuclear activity) and NGC 4654 (a combination of tidal\ntails and ram pressure effects). Almost all objects (except the anaemic NGC\n4548) exhibit distortions in polarized radio continuum attributable to\ninfluence of the ambient gas. For some galaxies they agree with observations of\nother species, but sometimes (NGC 4535) the magnetic field is the only tracer\nof the interaction with the cluster environment. The cluster environment\nclearly affects the evolution of the galaxies due to ram pressure and tidal\neffects. Magnetic fields provide a very long-lasting memory of past\ninteractions. Therefore, they are a good tracer of weak interactions which are\ndifficult to detect by other observations.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20066972	astro-ph	13 pages, 12 figures

Nanosci. 5, 422-448 (2008)	  This review presents the elastic theory of low-dimensional (one- and\ntwo-dimensional) continua and its applications in bio- and nano-structures.\nFirst, the curve and surface theory, as the geometric representation of the\nlow-dimensional continua, is briefly described through Cartan moving frame\nmethod. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,\nfluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nbio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,\nare discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the\ntheory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid\nmembranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a\ncomposite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little\nsimilar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances\nhighly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nnano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A\nrevised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density\napproximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures\nand strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical\nmechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based\non this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial\nconcepts, the Young's modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled\ncarbon nanotubes, with this continuum form.\n	\N	cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci math-ph math.MP physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM	Review article for J.

A SM-like gauge theory with p lepton families can be\nextended by introducing q heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos but preserving\nits SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge symmetry. The overall neutrino mass matrix M turns\nout to be a symmetric (p+q) x (p+q) matrix. Given p>q, the rank of M is in\ngeneral equal to 2q, corresponding to 2q non-zero mass eigenvalues. The\nexistence of (p-q) massless left-handed Majorana neutrinos is an exact\nconsequence of the model, independent of the usual approximation made in\nderiving the Type-I seesaw relation between the effective p x p light Majorana\nneutrino mass matrix M_\\nu and the q x q heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix\nM_R. In other words, the numbers of massive left- and right-handed neutrinos\nare fairly matched. A good example to illustrate this seesaw fair play rule is\nthe minimal seesaw model with p=3 and q=2, in which one massless neutrino sits\non the unbalanced seesaw.\n	10.1088/1674-1137/32/2/004	hep-ph	RevTex 8 pages, 1 PS figure.

They are, however, significantly different in the\ndust temperature: a cold (21 K) ring for NGC2841 and a warm (30 K) ring for\nNGC2976, which presumably reflects the difference in the origin of the ring\nstructure for the different Hubble type of the galaxy. In addition to the dust\nring structure, a warm dust component is detected from the central region of\nNGC2841, which may be attributed to the heating by its Low-Ionization Nuclear\nEmission-line Region nucleus. As for NGC2976, an extended dust component is\nobserved along the minor axis, which shows a distribution somewhat asymmetrical\nto the galactic disk; this might be associated with the HI bridge in the\nM81/M82 group that NGC2976 belongs to. By taking advantage of a wealth of the\nfar-IR bands of the FIS, it is demonstrated that the spectral energy\ndistribution of NGC2841 is spatially more variable than that of NGC2976.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp2.S463	astro-ph	22 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ AKARI special\n  issue
277	0706.0070	In-orbit focal adjustment of the AKARI telescope with IRC images	2007-06-01	\N	\N	  AKARI currently in space carries onboard a cryogenically-cooled lightweight\ntelescope with silicon carbide mirrors. The wavefront error of the AKARI\ntelescope obtained in laboratory measurements at 9 K showed that expected\nin-orbit imaging performance was diffraction-limited at a wavelength of 6.2 um.\nThe AKARI telescope has a function of focus adjustment by shifting the\nsecondary mirror in parallel to the optical axis. On the 4th day after the\njettison of the cryostat aperture lid in the orbit, we observed a star with the\nInfraRed Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI. Since the initial star images observed in\nthe near-infrared (IR) bands were significantly blurred, we twice moved the\nsecondary mirror for the focal adjustment based on the results of model\nanalyses as well as data analyses of the near-IR images. In consequence, we\nhave successfully adjusted the focus of the telescope. The in-orbit imaging\nperformance thus obtained for the AKARI telescope is diffraction-limited at a\nwavelength of 7.3 um, slightly degraded from that expected from the laboratory\nmeasurement.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp2.S423	astro-ph	14 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ AKARI special\n  issue
278	0706.0189	Diagnostic tools for 3D unstructured oceanographic data	2007-06-01	2007-08-07	\N	  Most ocean models in current use are built upon structured meshes. It follows\nthat most existing tools for extracting diagnostic quantities (volume and\nsurface integrals, for example) from ocean model output are constructed using\ntechniques and software tools which assume structured meshes. The greater\ncomplexity inherent in unstructured meshes (especially fully unstructured grids\nwhich are unstructured in the vertical as well as the horizontal direction) has\nleft some oceanographers, accustomed to traditional methods, unclear on how to\ncalculate diagnostics on these meshes. In this paper we show that tools for\nextracting diagnostic data from the new generation of unstructured ocean models\ncan be constructed with relative ease using open source software. Higher level\nlanguages such as Python, in conjunction with packages such as NumPy, SciPy,\nVTK and MayaVi, provide many of the high-level primitives needed to perform 3D\nvisualisation and evaluate diagnostic quantities, e.g. density fluxes. We\ndemonstrate this in the particular case of calculating flux of vector fields\nthrough isosurfaces, using flow data obtained from the unstructured mesh finite\nelement ocean code ICOM, however this tool can be applied to model output from\nany unstructured grid ocean code.\n	10.1016/j.ocemod.2007.08.004	physics.ao-ph	\N

II.\n  The evolution of magnetic fields as revealed by observations of Ap stars in\n  open clusters and associations	2007-06-03	\N	\N	  The evolution of magnetic fields in Ap stars during the main sequence phase\nis presently mostly unconstrained by observation because of the difficulty of\nassigning accurate ages to known field Ap stars.\n  We are carrying out a large survey of magnetic fields in cluster Ap stars\nwith the goal of obtaining a sample of these stars with well-determined ages.\nIn this paper we analyse the information available from the survey as it\ncurrently stands.\n  We select from the available observational sample the stars that are probably\n(1) cluster or association members and (2) magnetic Ap stars. For the stars in\nthis subsample we determine the fundamental parameters T_eff, log(L/L_o), and\nM/M_o. With these data and the cluster ages we assign both absolute age and\nfractional age (the fraction of the main sequence lifetime completed). For this\npurpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for Ap stars.\n  Magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of Ap stars from the ZAMS to the\nTAMS. Statistically for the stars with M > 3 M_o the fields decline with\nadvancing age approximately as expected from flux conservation together with\nincreased stellar radius, or perhaps even faster than this rate, on a time\nscale of about 3 10^7 yr. In contrast, lower mass stars show no compelling\nevidence for field decrease even on a timescale of several times 10^8 yr.\n  Study of magnetic cluster stars is now a powerful tool for obtaining\nconstraints on evolution of Ap stars through the main sequence. Enlarging the\nsample of known cluster magnetic stars, and obtaining more precise RMS fields,\nwill help to clarify the results obtained so far. Further field observations\nare in progress.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20077343	astro-ph	Accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics

Currently, a major\nchallenge is to achieve a QKD system with a 40 dB channel loss, which is\nrequired if we are to realize global scale QKD networks using communication\nsatellites. Here we report the first QKD experiment in which secure keys were\ndistributed over 42 dB channel loss and 200 km of optical fibre. We employed\nthe differential phase shift quantum key distribution (DPS-QKD) protocol\nimplemented with a 10-GHz clock frequency, and superconducting single photon\ndetectors (SSPD) based on NbN nanowire. The SSPD offers a very low dark count\nrate (a few Hz) and small timing jitter (60 ps full width at half maximum).\nThese characteristics allowed us to construct a 10-GHz clock QKD system and\nthus distribute secure keys over channel loss of 42 dB. In addition, we\nachieved a 17 kbit/s secure key rate over 105 km of optical fibre, which is two\norders of magnitude higher than the previous record, and a 12.1 bit/s secure\nkey rate over 200 km of optical fibre, which is the longest terrestrial QKD yet\ndemonstrated. The keys generated in our experiment are secure against both\ngeneral collective attacks on individual photons and a specific collective\nattack on multi-photons, known as a sequential unambiguous state discrimination\n(USD) attack.\n	10.1038/nphoton.2007.75	quant-ph	15 pages, 5 figures.

The\nmodel is based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient\ninto elastic and inelastic part. An additional multiplicative decomposition of\ninelastic part is used to describe a nonlinear kinematic hardening of\nArmstrong-Frederick type.\n  Two implicit time-stepping methods are adopted for numerical integration of\nevolution equations, such that the plastic incompressibility constraint is\nexactly satisfied. The first method is based on the tensor exponential. The\nsecond method is a modified Euler-Backward method. Special numerical tests show\nthat both approaches yield similar results even for finite inelastic\nincrements.\n  The basic features of the material response, predicted by the material model,\nare illustrated with a series of numerical simulations.\n	10.1016/j.cma.2007.12.017	math.NA	29 pages, 7 figures

Reachability-based secrecy\nmeans that s should never be disclosed while equivalence-based secrecy states\nthat two executions of a protocol with distinct instances for s should be\nindistinguishable to an attacker. Although the second formulation ensures a\nhigher level of security and is closer to cryptographic notions of secrecy,\ndecidability results and automatic tools have mainly focused on the first\ndefinition so far.\n  This paper initiates a systematic investigation of the situations where\nsyntactic secrecy entails strong secrecy. We show that in the passive case,\nreachability-based secrecy actually implies equivalence-based secrecy for\ndigital signatures, symmetric and asymmetric encryption provided that the\nprimitives are probabilistic. For active adversaries, we provide sufficient\n(and rather tight) conditions on the protocol for this implication to hold.\n	10.2168/LMCS-3(3:2)2007	cs.CR cs.LO	29 pages, published in LMCS

We present an interpolant-based method for strengthening the\nabstract transition relation in case of such failures. This approach guarantees\nconvergence given an adequate set of predicates, without requiring an exact\nimage computation.

R band\nphotometric data points were obtained on 2005 October 28 (UT), or 0.095-0.180\ndays after the burst. There is a possible plateau in the optical light curve\naround 0.1 days after the burst; the light curve resembles optically bright\nafterglows (e.g. GRB 041006, GRB 050319, GRB060605) in shape of the light curve\nbut not in brightness.

Detailed considerations are made for two specific\nmethods of polarization entanglement preparation, based on type-II spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion (SPDC) and on SPDC in two subsequent type-I crystals\nproducing orthogonally polarized photon pairs.

Recently, the problem of discriminating multipartite unitary operations by\nlocal operations and classical communication (LOCC) has attracted significant\nattention. The latest work in the literature on this problem showed that two\nmultipartite unitary operations can always be perfectly distinguished by LOCC\nwhen a finite number of runs are allowable. However, in these schemes, local\nentanglement (an entangled state holden by one party) was required, which seems\nto imply that local entanglement is necessary for perfect discrimination\nbetween unitary operations by LOCC. In this article, we show that a perfect\ndiscrimination between two unitary operations acting on a two-qudits can always\nbe achieved without exploiting any entanglement. As a result, we conclude that\nlocal entanglement is not necessary for perfect discrimination between unitary\noperations acting on two-qudits by LOCC.\n	10.1103/PhysRevA.77.032337	quant-ph	6 pages, 2 figures, we have added Lemma 5 and its proof, and some\n  sentences have been modified and supplemented, as well
300	0706.0961	The InterHourly-Variability (IHV) Index of Geomagnetic Activity and its\n  Use in Deriving the Long-term Variation of Solar Wind Speed	2007-06-07	\N	\N	  We describe the derivation of the InterHourly Variability (IHV) index of\ngeomagnetic activity. The IHV-index for a geomagnetic element is mechanically\nderived from hourly values as the sum of the unsigned differences between\nadjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. The index\nis derived separately for stations in both hemispheres within six longitude\nsectors using only local night hours. It is intended as a long-term index.\nAvailable data allows derivation of the index back well into the 19th century.\nOn a time scale of a 27-day Bartels rotation, IHV averages for stations with\ncorrected geomagnetic latitude less than 55 degrees are strongly correlated\nwith midlatitude range indices. Assuming a constant calibration of the aa-index\nwe find that observed yearly values of aa before the year 1957 are 2.9 nT too\nsmall compared to values calculated from IHV using the regression constants\nbased on 1980-2004. We interpret this discrepancy as an indication that the\ncalibration of the aa index is in error before 1957. There is no such problem\nwith the ap index. Rotation averages of IHV are also strongly correlated with\nsolar wind parameters (BV^2). On a time scale of a year combining the IHV-index\nand the recently-developed Inter-Diurnal Variability (IDV) index (giving B)\nallows determination of solar wind speed, V, from 1890-present. Over the\n~120-year series, the yearly mean solar wind speed varied from a low of 303\nkm/s in 1902 to a high value of 545 km/s in 2003. The calculated yearly values\nof the product BV using B and V separately derived from IDV and IHV agree\nquantitatively with (completely independent) BV derived from the amplitude of\nthe diurnal variation of the H component in the polar caps since 1926 and\nsporadically beyond.\n	10.1029/2007JA012437	astro-ph	\N

303	0706.1079	Co-orbital Oligarchy	2007-06-07	2009-01-12	\N	  We present a systematic examination of the changes in semi-major axis caused\nby the mutual interactions of a group of massive bodies orbiting a central star\nin the presence of eccentricity dissipation. For parameters relevant to the\noligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typical\neccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. Interactions at impact\nparameters greater than several Hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel each\nother; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the Hill radius, the\nprotoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwise\nunperturbed. If the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by less\nthan a Hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing between\ntheir neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. In the\nshear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feeding\nzones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. Growth of the protoplanets\nin the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration that\ndepends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\\Sigma/\\sigma$.\nEarly in the oligarchic phase, when $\\Sigma/\\sigma$ is low, the spacing between\nrows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 Hill radii wide, rather than the 10\nHill radii cited in the literature. It is likely that at the end of oligarchy\nthe average number of co-orbital oligarchs is greater than unity. In the outer\nsolar system this raises the disk mass required to form the ice giants. In the\ninner solar system this lowers the mass of the final oligarchs and requires\nmore giant impacts than previously estimated. This result provides additional\nevidence that Mars is not an untouched leftover from the oligarchic phase, but\nmust be composed of several oligarchs assembled through giant impacts.\n	10.1088/0004-6256/137/4/3778	astro-ph	10 pages, 8 figures. v2 includes major revisions including additional\n  results motivated by the referee's comments

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters. We suggest that star\nformation may proceed in the stripped ISM, in both the galactic halo and\nintracluster space. The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation. The data also imply that ESO\n137-001 is in an active stage of transformation, accompanied by the build-up of\na central bulge and depletion of the ISM.\n	10.1086/522690	astro-ph	16 pages, 1 table, 6 figures (4 in color), emulateapj5.sty, to appear\n  in ApJ, December 10, 2007, v671, n1.

309	0706.1241	Inside-Out Evacuation of Transitional Protoplanetary Disks by the\n  Magneto-Rotational Instability	2007-06-10	\N	\N	  How do T Tauri disks accrete? The magneto-rotational instability (MRI)\nsupplies one means, but protoplanetary disk gas is typically too poorly ionized\nto be magnetically active. Here we show that the MRI can, in fact, explain\nobserved accretion rates for the sub-class of T Tauri disks known as\ntransitional systems. Transitional disks are swept clean of dust inside rim\nradii of ~10 AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize material in the disk rim,\nactivating the MRI there. Gas flows from the rim to the star, at a rate limited\nby the depth to which X-rays ionize the rim wall. The wider the rim, the larger\nthe surface area that the rim wall exposes to X-rays, and the greater the\naccretion rate. Interior to the rim, the MRI continues to transport gas; the\nMRI is sustained even at the disk midplane by super-keV X-rays that Compton\nscatter down from the disk surface. Accretion is therefore steady inside the\nrim. Blown out by radiation pressure, dust largely fails to accrete with gas.\nContrary to what is usually assumed, ambipolar diffusion, not Ohmic\ndissipation, limits how much gas is MRI-active. We infer values for the\ntransport parameter alpha on the order of 0.01 for GM Aur, TW Hyd, and DM Tau.\nBecause the MRI can only afflict a finite radial column of gas at the rim, disk\nproperties inside the rim are insensitive to those outside. Thus our picture\nprovides one robust setting for planet-disk interaction: a protoplanet interior\nto the rim will interact with gas whose density, temperature, and transport\nproperties are definite and decoupled from uncertain initial conditions. Our\nstudy also supplies half the answer to how disks dissipate: the inner disk\ndrains from the inside out by the MRI, while the outer disk photoevaporates by\nstellar ultraviolet radiation.\n	10.1038/nphys661	astro-ph	Accepted to Nature Physics June 7, 2007.

Over the RF frequency\nrange of 205-240 GHz, the single-sideband receiver noise temperatures of the\nnew mixer are 40-100 K for the 4.0-8.0 GHz IF frequency band.

313	0706.1516	Creating pseudo Kondo-resonances by field-induced diffusion of atomic\n  hydrogen	2007-06-11	\N	\N	  In low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments a cerium\nadatom on Ag(100) possesses two discrete states with significantly different\napparent heights. These atomic switches also exhibit a Kondo-like feature in\nspectroscopy experiments. By extensive theoretical simulations we find that\nthis behavior is due to diffusion of hydrogen from the surface onto the Ce\nadatom in the presence of the STM tip field. The cerium adatom possesses\nvibrational modes of very low energy (3-4meV) and very high efficiency (> 20%),\nwhich are due to the large changes of Ce-states in the presence of hydrogen.\nThe atomic vibrations lead to a Kondo-like feature at very low bias voltages.\nWe predict that the same low-frequency/high-efficiency modes can also be\nobserved at lanthanum adatoms.\n	10.1088/0957-4484/19/30/305701	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	five pages and four figures
314	0706.1645	Dynamics of Three Agent Games	2007-06-12	\N	J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 41 055002, 2008.	  We study the dynamics and resulting score distribution of three-agent games\nwhere after each competition a single agent wins and scores a point. A single\ncompetition is described by a triplet of numbers $p$, $t$ and $q$ denoting the\nprobabilities that the team with the highest, middle or lowest accumulated\nscore wins. We study the full family of solutions in the regime, where the\nnumber of agents and competitions is large, which can be regarded as a\nhydrodynamic limit. Depending on the parameter values $(p,q,t)$, we find six\nqualitatively different asymptotic score distributions and we also provide a\nqualitative understanding of these results. We checked our analytical results\nagainst numerical simulations of the microscopic model and find these to be in\nexcellent agreement. The three agent game can be regarded as a social model\nwhere a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement, based on his/her\naccumulated score. It is also possible to decide the outcome of a three agent\ngame through a mini tournament of two-a gent competitions among the\nparticipating players and it turns out that the resulting possible score\ndistributions are a subset of those obtained for the general three agent-games.\nWe discuss how one can add a steady and democratic decline rate to the model\nand present a simple geometric construction that allows one to write down the\ncorresponding score evolution equations for $n$-agent games.\n	10.1088/1751-8113/41/5/055002	physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech	\N

Exact results are recovered for some self-similar cylindrical\nand spherical shocks with power-law pre-shock density profiles.

The footpoints of 1 MK TRACE loops are shown to emit strongly in\nemission lines formed at log T=5.4-5.8, allowing the temperature increase along\nthe footpoints to be clearly seen.

Res. 113, B06301 (2008)	  Spatiotemporal correlations of the two-dimensional spring-block\n(Burridge-Knopoff) model of earthquakes are extensively studied by means of\nnumerical computer simulations. The model is found to exhibit either\n``subcritical'' or ``supercritical'' behavior, depending on the values of the\nmodel parameters. Transition between these regimes is either continuous or\ndiscontinuous. Seismic events in the ``subcritical'' regime and those in the\n``supercritical'' regime at larger magnitudes exhibit universal scaling\nproperties. In the ``supercritical'' regime, eminent spatiotemporal\ncorrelations, {\\it e.g.}, remarkable growth of seismic activity preceding the\nmainshock, arise in earthquake occurrence, whereas such spatiotemporal\ncorrelations are significantly suppressed in the ``subcritical'' regime.\nSeismic activity is generically suppressed just before the mainshock in a close\nvicinity of the epicenter of the upcoming event while it remains to be active\nin the surroundings (the Mogi doughnut). It is also observed that, before and\nafter the mainshock, the apparent $B$-value of the magnitude distribution\ndecreases or increases in the ``supercritical'' or ``subcritical'' regimes,\nrespectively.

The direct and tree schemes are combined using an extension of the\nmixed variable symplectic (MVS) scheme. Thus, the Hamiltonian corresponding to\neverything other than the internal motion of the star cluster is integrated\nwith the leapfrog, which is symplectic. Using this algorithm, we performed\nfully self-consistent N-body simulations of star clusters in their parent\ngalaxy. The internal and orbital evolutions of the star cluster agreed well\nwith those obtained using the direct scheme. We also performed fully\nself-consistent N-body simulation for large-N models ($N=2\\times 10^6$).

Coupled electron spins in semiconductor double quantum dots hold promise as\nthe basis for solid-state qubits. To date, most experiments have used III-V\nmaterials, in which coherence is limited by hyperfine interactions. Ge/Si\nheterostructure nanowires seem ideally suited to overcome this limitation: the\npredominance of spin-zero nuclei suppresses the hyperfine interaction and\nchemical synthesis creates a clean and defect-free system with highly\ncontrollable properties. Here we present a top gate-defined double quantum dot\nbased on Ge/Si heterostructure nanowires with fully tunable coupling between\nthe dots and to the leads. We also demonstrate a novel approach to charge\nsensing in a one-dimensional nanostructure by capacitively coupling the double\ndot to a single dot on an adjacent nanowire. The double quantum dot and\nintegrated charge sensor serve as an essential building block required to form\na solid-state spin qubit free of nuclear spin.\n	10.1038/nnano.2007.302	cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci	Related work at http://marcuslab.harvard.edu and\n  http://cmliris.harvard.edu

In this paper is presented a new procedure\nthat allows, for the first time, the experimental determination of the surface\nstress polar dependence of a crystal.

In contrast to the previous\ninvestigations, we let the dual string be moving along the deformed $S^5$ and\nfind the exact expression of the interquark potential. The potential shows a\nCoulomb behavior at all distance and does not have a minimum distance between\nquarks, which exhibits in the static configuration. After comparing the\npotential of the static and moving configurations we find that while the dual\nstring is static at long distance it will transit to a moving configuration at\nshort distance. We also analyze an electric dipole system and find that it\nshows a similar transition property.

We call a Markov chain decisive w.r.t. a given\nset of target states F if it almost certainly eventually reaches either F or a\nstate from which F can no longer be reached. While all finite Markov chains are\ntrivially decisive (for every set F), this also holds for many classes of\ninfinite Markov chains. Infinite Markov chains which contain a finite attractor\nare decisive w.r.t. every set F. In particular, this holds for probabilistic\nlossy channel systems (PLCS). Furthermore, all globally coarse Markov chains\nare decisive. This class includes probabilistic vector addition systems (PVASS)\nand probabilistic noisy Turing machines (PNTM). We consider both safety and\nliveness problems for decisive Markov chains, i.e., the probabilities that a\ngiven set of states F is eventually reached or reached infinitely often,\nrespectively. 1. We express the qualitative problems in abstract terms for\ndecisive Markov chains, and show an almost complete picture of its decidability\nfor PLCS, PVASS and PNTM. 2. We also show that the path enumeration algorithm\nof Iyer and Narasimha terminates for decisive Markov chains and can thus be\nused to solve the approximate quantitative safety problem. A modified variant\nof this algorithm solves the approximate quantitative liveness problem. 3.\nFinally, we show that the exact probability of (repeatedly) reaching F cannot\nbe effectively expressed (in a uniform way) in Tarski-algebra for either PLCS,\nPVASS or (P)NTM.\n	10.2168/LMCS-3(4:7)2007	cs.LO cs.DM	32 pages, 0 figures

An observation-based strategy relies on\nimperfect information about the history of a play, namely, on the past sequence\nof observations. Such games occur in the synthesis of a controller that does\nnot see the private state of the plant. Our main results are twofold. First, we\ngive a fixed-point algorithm for computing the set of states from which a\nplayer can win with a deterministic observation-based strategy for any\nomega-regular objective. The fixed point is computed in the lattice of\nantichains of state sets. This algorithm has the advantages of being directed\nby the objective and of avoiding an explicit subset construction on the game\ngraph. Second, we give an algorithm for computing the set of states from which\na player can win with probability 1 with a randomized observation-based\nstrategy for a Buechi objective.

The blue-shifted, warm ($\\sim 200-300$ K),\ndense ($>10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) molecular gas suggested by CO absorption in IRAS\n08752+3915 could be caused by the innermost region of the inhomogeneous\ninter-stellar medium (ISM) around a supermassive black hole. The infrequent\nobservations of the dense gas with absorption in ULIRGs and Seyfert 2 galaxies\ncould simply suggest that the high-density regions occupy only a very small\nvolume fraction of the obscuring material. This is naturally expected if the\ninhomogeneous structure of the ISM is caused by non-linear development of\ninstabilities. The model predicts a turbulent velocity field in the obscuring\nmaterial, therefore blue- and red-shifted gases should be observable with\nnearly the same probability for the large enough statistical samples.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.4.711	astro-ph	14 pages, 6 figures.

One approach to understanding the emergence of this\nresponse is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory\ndata with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is\nbelieved that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across\nneurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively\nsmall number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of\nsparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been\nproposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the\nspecific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still\nlargely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural\nrepresentation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism\nthat optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding\nalgorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from\nnatural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms.\nResults show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding\nresults, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of\nnatural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding\nis optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical\ncompetition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more\nefficient solution to the emergence of independent components.\n	10.1162/neco.2010.05-08-795	q-bio.NC	\N
353	0706.3190	Equilibrium nano-shape changes induced by epitaxial stress (generalised\n  Wulf-Kaishew theorem)	2007-06-21	\N	Surface Science 457 (2000) 229	  A generalised Wulf-Kaishew theorem is given describing the equilibrium shape\n(ES) of an isolated 3D crystal A deposited coherently onto a lattice mismatched\nplanar substrate. For this purpose a free polyhedral crystal is formed then\nhomogeneously strained to be accommodated onto the lattice mismatched\nsubstrate. During its elastic inhomogeneous relaxation the epitaxial contact\nremains coherent so that the 3D crystal drags the atoms of the contact area and\nproduces a strain field in the substrate. The ES of the deposit is obtained by\nminimising at constant volume the total energy (bulk and surface energies)\ntaking into account the bulk elastic relaxation. Our main results are: (1)\nEpitaxial strain acts against wetting (adhesion) so that globally it leads to a\nthickening of the ES. (2) Owing to strain the ES changes with size. More\nprecisely the various facets extension changes, some facets decreasing, some\nothers increasing. (3) Each dislocation entrance, necessary for relaxing\nplastically too large crystals abruptly modifies the ES and thus the different\nfacets extension in a jerky way. (4) In all cases the usual self-similarity\nwith size is lost when misfit is considered. We illustrate these points in case\nof box shaped and truncated pyramidal crystals.

From photometric observations using Suprime-Cam on\nthe Subaru Telescope, we have picked up stars brighter than 22 mag (in\n$V$-band) for spectroscopy, which are located within a circular region with the\nradius of 30" around the center of SNR Tycho. If the ejecta of young supernova\nremnants, such as SNR Tycho, have a sufficient amount of Fe I, we should be\nable to detect absorption lines at 3720 \\AA and 3860 \\AA associated with\ntransitions from the ground state of Fe I in the spectrum of the companion\nstar. To identify the companion star of a SN Ia using these characteristic\nabsorption lines of Fe I, we made optical low-resolution spectroscopy of their\ntargets using FOCAS on the Subaru Telescope. In our spectroscopic observations,\nwe obtained spectra of 17 stars in the SNR Tycho region and compare them with\ntemplate stellar spectra. We detect significant absorption lines from two stars\nat 3720 \\AA. Since widths of their absorption lines are broad, it is likely\nthat the detected absorptions are due to Fe I in the expanding ejecta of SNR\nTycho. However, none of stars exhibits a clear red wing in the observed\nprofiles of the absorption, though a star in the background of the SNR should\nshow it. Hence, we suggest another interpretation that the detected absorption\nlines might be caused by the peculiarity of stars. A star named Tycho(E) has\nthe absorption line at 3720 \\AA and its projected position is close to the\ncenter of SNR Tycho. Based on our observations, Tycho(E) is a new candidate as\nthe companion star of Tycho's supernova.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.4.811	astro-ph	17 pages, 28 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ

We show that a relativistic version of Schrodinger cat states, here called\nDirac cat states, can be built in relativistic Landau levels when an external\nmagnetic field couples to a relativistic spin 1/2 charged particle. Under\nsuitable initial conditions, the associated Dirac equation produces unitarily\nDirac cat states involving the orbital quanta of the particle in a well defined\nmesoscopic regime. We demonstrate that the proposed Dirac cat states have a\npurely relativistic origin and cease to exist in the non-relativistic limit. In\nthis manner, we expect to open relativistic quantum mechanics to the rich\nstructures of quantum optics and quantum information.\n	10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.123602	quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall hep-th	Revtex4, color figures, submitted for publication

357	0706.3541	Beyond Gross-Pitaevskii Mean Field Theory	2007-06-24	\N	\N	  A large number of effects related to the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein\nCondensation (BEC) can be understood in terms of lowest order mean field\ntheory, whereby the entire system is assumed to be condensed, with thermal and\nquantum fluctuations completely ignored. Such a treatment leads to the\nGross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) used extensively throughout this book. Although\nthis theory works remarkably well for a broad range of experimental parameters,\na more complete treatment is required for understanding various experiments,\nincluding experiments with solitons and vortices. Such treatments should\ninclude the dynamical coupling of the condensate to the thermal cloud, the\neffect of dimensionality, the role of quantum fluctuations, and should also\ndescribe the critical regime, including the process of condensate formation.\nThe aim of this Chapter is to give a brief but insightful overview of various\nrecent theories, which extend beyond the GPE. To keep the discussion brief,\nonly the main notions and conclusions will be presented. This Chapter\ngeneralizes the presentation of Chapter 1, by explicitly maintaining\nfluctuations around the condensate order parameter. While the theoretical\narguments outlined here are generic, the emphasis is on approaches suitable for\ndescribing single weakly-interacting atomic Bose gases in harmonic traps.\nInteresting effects arising when condensates are trapped in double-well\npotentials and optical lattices, as well as the cases of spinor condensates,\nand atomic-molecular coupling, along with the modified or alternative theories\nneeded to describe them, will not be covered here.\n	10.1007/978-3-540-73591-5_18	cond-mat.other	Review Article (19 Pages) - To appear in 'Emergent Nonlinear\n  Phenomena in Bose-Einstein Condensates: Theory and Experiment', Edited by\n  P.G.

360	0706.3744	The Imprint of Cosmic Reionization on Galaxy Clustering	2007-06-25	\N	\N	  We consider the effect of reionization on the clustering properties of galaxy\nsamples at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3-5.5). Current models for the\nreionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will be\nreionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitors\nof massive lower-redshift galaxies. As a result, the stellar populations\nobserved in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hence\nbrighter in overdense regions of the Universe. Galaxy surveys would therefore\nbe sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdense\nregions. The corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxies\ncan be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. We model this\nprocess using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. Our model\ndemonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clustering\nproperties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formation\nproperties. The bias correction in Lyman-break galaxies (including those in\nproposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z<1) is at the level of 10-20% for a\nhalo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in the\nhalo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. The reionization of\nhelium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxy\ncorrelation function at z~3. We find that the reionization bias is\napproximately independent of scale and halo mass. However since the traditional\ngalaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively more\nimportant for lower mass systems. The correction to the bias due to\nreionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z<1.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12447.x	astro-ph	17 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to MNRAS

The magnetic impurity acts as a\nspin-dependent $\\delta$-potential for electrons and results in gaps in the\nenergy spectrum, consequently suppresses the oscillation of the persistent\ncurrents. The competition between the Zeeman splittings and the $s$-$d$\nexchange interaction leads to a transition of the electron ground state in the\nring.

Amongst the main novel properties are the\nfollowing: i) The basins of attraction for the phases of the cycles develop\nfractal boundaries of increasing complexity as the period-doubling structure\nadvances towards the transition to chaos. ii) The fractal boundaries, formed by\nthe preimages of the repellor, display hierarchical structures organized\naccording to exponential clusterings that manifest in the dynamics as\nsensitivity to the final state and transient chaos. iii) There is a functional\ncomposition renormalization group (RG) fixed-point map associated to the family\nof supercycles. iv) This map is given in closed form by the same kind of\n$q$-exponential function found for both the pitchfork and tangent bifurcation\nattractors. v) There is a final stage ultra-fast dynamics towards the attractor\nwith a sensitivity to initial conditions that decreases as an exponential of an\nexponential of time.\n	10.2478/s11534-009-0065-1	cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.CD	8 pages, 13 figures
362	0706.3943	The globular cluster system in NGC5866: optical observations from HST\n  Advanced Camera for Surveys	2007-06-26	\N	\N	  We perform a detailed study of the Globular Cluster (GC) system in the galaxy\nNGC5866 based on F435W, F555W, and F625W (~ B, V, and R) HST Advanced Camera\nfor Surveys images.\n  Adopting color, size and shape selection criteria, the final list of GC\ncandidates comprises 109 objects, with small estimated contamination from\nbackground galaxies, and foreground stars.\n  The color distribution of the final GC sample has a bimodal form. Adopting\ncolor to metallicity transformations derived from the Teramo--SPoT simple\nstellar population model, we estimate a metallicity [Fe/H]~ -1.5, and -0.6 dex\nfor the blue and red peaks, respectively. A similar result is found if the\nempirical color-metallicity relations derived from Galactic GCs data are used.\n  The two subpopulations show some of the features commonly observed in the GC\nsystem of other galaxies, like a ``blue tilt'', higher central concentrations\nof the red subsystem, and larger half--light radii at larger galactocentric\ndistances. However, we do not find evidence of a substantial difference between\nthe average sizes of red and blue clusters.\n  Our analysis of the GC Luminosity Function indicates a V-band Turn-Over\nMagnitude V$_0^{TOM}$=23.46+-0.06, or M$_{V,0}^{TOM}\\sim-7.29 +- 0.10$ mag,\nusing the distance modulus derived from the average of SBF and the PNLF\ndistances. The absolute Turn-Over Magnitude obtained agrees well with\ncalibrations from literature. The specific frequency is measured to be $S_N=1.4\n+- 0.3$, typical for galaxies of this type.\n	10.1086/521218	astro-ph	ApJ, accepted

364	0706.4073	Some generic properties of level spacing distributions of 2D real random\n  matrices	2007-06-27	\N	\N	  We study the level spacing distribution $P(S)$ of 2D real random matrices\nboth symmetric as well as general, non-symmetric. In the general case we\nrestrict ourselves to Gaussian distributed matrix elements, but different\nwidths of the various matrix elements are admitted. The following results are\nobtained: An explicit exact formula for $P(S)$ is derived and its behaviour\nclose to S=0 is studied analytically, showing that there is linear level\nrepulsion, unless there are additional constraints for the probability\ndistribution of the matrix elements. The constraint of having only positive or\nonly negative but otherwise arbitrary non-diagonal elements leads to quadratic\nlevel repulsion with logarithmic corrections. These findings detail and extend\nour previous results already published in a preceding paper. For the {\\em\nsymmetric} real 2D matrices also other, non-Gaussian statistical distributions\nare considered. In this case we show for arbitrary statistical distribution of\nthe diagonal and non-diagonal elements that the level repulsion exponent $\\rho$\nis always $\\rho = 1$, provided the distribution function of the matrix elements\nis regular at zero value. If the distribution function of the matrix elements\nis a singular (but still integrable) power law near zero value of $S$, the\nlevel spacing distribution $P(S)$ is a fractional exponent pawer law at small\n$S$. The tail of $P(S)$ depends on further details of the matrix element\nstatistics. We explicitly work out four cases: the constant (box) distribution,\nthe Cauchy-Lorentz distribution, the exponential distribution and, as an\nexample for a singular distribution, the power law distribution for $P(S)$ near\nzero value times an exponential tail.\n	10.1515/zna-2007-0902	nlin.CD	21 pages, no figures, submitted to Zeitschrift fuer Naturforschung A

Lett. 100, 230401 (2008)	  We apply the configuration-interaction method to calculate the spectra of\ntwo-component Fermi systems in a harmonic trap, studying the convergence of the\nmethod at the unitary interaction limit. We find that for a fixed\nregularization of the two-body interaction the convergence is exponential or\nbetter in the truncation parameter of the many-body space. However, the\nconventional regularization is found to have poor convergence in the\nregularization parameter, with an error that scales as a low negative power of\nthis parameter. We propose a new regularization of the two-body interaction\nthat produces exponential convergence for systems of three and four particles.\n  From the systematics, we estimate the ground-state energy of the\nfour-particle system to be (5.05 +- 0.024)hbar omega.\n	10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.230401	cond-mat.other nucl-th physics.atom-ph	4 pages, 3 figures

Firstly, we review the five-dimensional\napproach to the Galilean Dirac equation, which leads to the Levy-Leblond\nequations, and define the Galilean generating functional and Green's functions\nfor positive- and negative-energy/mass solutions. Then, as an example of\ninteractions, we consider the quartic self-interacting potential ${\\lambda}\n(\\bar{\\Psi} {\\Psi})^2$, and we derive expressions for the 2- and 4-point\nGreen's functions. Our results are compatible with those found in the\nliterature on non-relativistic many-body systems. The extended manifold allows\nfor compact expressions of the contributions in $(3+1)$ space-time. This is\nparticularly apparent when we represent the results with diagrams in the\nextended $(4+1)$ manifold, since they usually encompass more diagrams in\nGalilean $(3+1)$ space-time.\n	10.1016/j.aop.2007.08.002	hep-th	LATEX file, 27 pages, 8 figures; typos in the journal version are\n  removed, equation (1) in Introduction is corrected
375	0706.4457	Dissipation Scale Fluctuations and Chemical Reaction Rates in Turbulent\n  Flows	2007-06-29	\N	\N	  Small separation between reactants, not exceeding $10^{-8}-10^{-7}cm$, is the\nnecessary condition for various chemical reactions. It is shown that random\nadvection and stretching by turbulence leads to formation of scalar-enriched\nsheets of {\\it strongly fluctuating thickness} $\\eta_{c}$. The molecular-level\nmixing is achieved by diffusion across these sheets (interfaces) separating the\nreactants. Since diffusion time scale is $\\tau_{d}\\propto \\eta_{c}^{2}$, the\nknowledge of probability density $Q(\\eta_{c},Re)$ is crucial for evaluation of\nchemical reaction rates. In this paper we derive the probability density\n$Q(\\eta_{c},Re,Sc)$ and predict a transition in the reaction rate behavior from\n${\\cal R}\\propto \\sqrt{Re}$ ($Re\\leq 10^{4}$) to the high-Re asymptotics ${\\cal\nR}\\propto Re^{0}$. The theory leads to an approximate universality of\ntransitional Reynolds number $Re_{tr}\\approx 10^{4}$. It is also shown that if\nchemical reaction involves short-lived reactants, very strong anomalous\nfluctuations of the length-scale $\\eta_{c}$ may lead to non-negligibly small\nreaction rates.\n	10.1017/S0022112008001791	nlin.CD astro-ph physics.flu-dyn	\N
367	0706.4209	Elastic relaxation during 2D epitaxial growth: a study of in-plane\n  lattice spacing oscillations	2007-06-28	\N	Surface Science 488 (2001) 52	  The purpose of this paper is to report some new experimental and theoretical\nresults about the analysis of in-plane lattice spacing oscillations during\ntwo-dimensional (2D) homo and hetero epitaxial growth. The physical origin of\nthese oscillations comes from the finite size of the strained islands. The 2D\nislands may thus relax by their edges, leading to in-plane lattice spacing\noscillations during the birth and spread of these islands. On the one hand, we\nformulate the problem of elastic relaxation of a coherent 2D epitaxial deposits\nby using the concept of point forces and demonstrate that the mean deformation\nin the islands exhibits an oscillatory behaviour. On the other hand, we\ncalculate the intensity diffracted by such coherently deposited 2D islands by\nusing a mean model of a pile-up of weakly deformed layers. The amplitude of\nin-plane lattice spacing oscillations is found to depend linearly on the misfit\nand roughly linearly on the nucleation density. We show that the nucleation\ndensity may be approximated from the full-width at half maximum of the\ndiffracted rods at half coverages. The predicted dependence of the in-plane\nlattice spacing oscillations amplitude with the nucleation density is thus\nexperimentally verified on V/Fe(001), Mn/Fe(001), Ni/Fe(001), Co/Cu(001) and\nV/V(001).\n	10.1016/S0039-6028(01)01081-0	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	39 pages, 10 figures

370	0706.4335	A single-photon transistor using nano-scale surface plasmons	2007-06-28	\N	\N	  It is well known that light quanta (photons) can interact with each other in\nnonlinear media, much like massive particles do, but in practice these\ninteractions are usually very weak. Here we describe a novel approach to\nrealize strong nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level. Our method\nmakes use of recently demonstrated efficient coupling between individual\noptical emitters and tightly confined, propagating surface plasmon excitations\non conducting nanowires. We show that this system can act as a nonlinear\ntwo-photon switch for incident photons propagating along the nanowire, which\ncan be coherently controlled using quantum optical techniques. As a novel\napplication, we discuss how the interaction can be tailored to create a\nsingle-photon transistor, where the presence or absence of a single incident\nphoton in a ``gate'' field is sufficient to completely control the propagation\nof subsequent ``signal'' photons.\n	10.1038/nphys708	quant-ph	20 pages, 4 figures
371	0706.4337	Directed Paths in a Wedge	2007-06-28	\N	\N	  Directed paths have been used extensively in the scientific literature as a\nmodel of a linear polymer. Such paths models in particular the conformational\nentropy of a linear polymer and the effects it has on the free energy. These\ndirected models are simplified versions of the self-avoiding walk, but they do\nnevertheless give insight into the phase behaviour of a polymer, and also serve\nas a tool to study the effects of conformational degrees of freedom in the\nbehaviour of a linear polymer. In this paper we examine a directed path model\nof a linear polymer in a confining geometry (a wedge). The main focus of our\nattention is $c_n$, the number of directed lattice paths of length $n$ steps\nwhich takes steps in the North-East and South-East directions and which is\nconfined to the wedge $Y=\\pm X/p$, where $p$ is an integer. In this paper we\nexamine the case $p=2$ in detail, and we determine the generating function\nusing the iterated kernel method. We also examine the asymtotics of $c_n$. In\nparticular, we show that $$ c_n = [0.67874...]\\times 2^{n-1}(1+(-1)^n) +\nO((4/3^{3/4})^{n+o(n)}) + o((4/3^{3/4})^n) $$ where we can determine the\nconstant $0.67874...$ to arbitrary accuracy with little effort.\n	10.1088/1751-8113/40/47/003	cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech math-ph math.CO math.MP	\N

379	0707.0114	Viral population estimation using pyrosequencing	2007-07-01	2008-01-21	\N	  The diversity of virus populations within single infected hosts presents a\nmajor difficulty for the natural immune response as well as for vaccine design\nand antiviral drug therapy. Recently developed pyrophosphate based sequencing\ntechnologies (pyrosequencing) can be used for quantifying this diversity by\nultra-deep sequencing of virus samples. We present computational methods for\nthe analysis of such sequence data and apply these techniques to pyrosequencing\ndata obtained from HIV populations within patients harboring drug resistant\nvirus strains. Our main result is the estimation of the population structure of\nthe sample from the pyrosequencing reads. This inference is based on a\nstatistical approach to error correction, followed by a combinatorial algorithm\nfor constructing a minimal set of haplotypes that explain the data. Using this\nset of explaining haplotypes, we apply a statistical model to infer the\nfrequencies of the haplotypes in the population via an EM algorithm. We\ndemonstrate that pyrosequencing reads allow for effective population\nreconstruction by extensive simulations and by comparison to 165 sequences\nobtained directly from clonal sequencing of four independent, diverse HIV\npopulations. Thus, pyrosequencing can be used for cost-effective estimation of\nthe structure of virus populations, promising new insights into viral\nevolutionary dynamics and disease control strategies.\n	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000074	q-bio.PE	23 pages, 13 figures
380	0707.0127	Design and Initial Performance of SHARP, a Polarimeter for the SHARC-II\n  Camera at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory	2007-07-01	\N	\N	  We have developed a fore-optics module that converts the SHARC-II camera at\nthe Caltech Submillimeter Observatory into a sensitive imaging polarimeter at\nwavelengths of 350 and 450 microns. We refer to this module as "SHARP". SHARP\nsplits the incident radiation into two orthogonally polarized beams that are\nthen re-imaged onto opposite ends of the 32 x 12 pixel detector array in\nSHARC-II. A rotating half-wave plate is used just upstream from the\npolarization-splitting optics. The effect of SHARP is to convert SHARC-II into\na dual-beam 12 x 12 pixel polarimeter. A novel feature of SHARP's design is the\nuse of a crossed grid in a submillimeter polarimeter. Here we describe the\ndetailed optical design of SHARP and present results of tests carried out\nduring our first few observing runs. At 350 microns, the beam size (9\narcseconds), throughput (75%), and instrumental polarization (< 1%) are all\nvery close to our design goals.\n	10.1364/AO.47.000422	astro-ph	submitted to Applied Optics

Several novel states have been discovered in\nspinels, such as composite spin clusters and novel charge-ordered states. Here\nwe use neutron and synchrotron X-ray scattering to characterize the fractional\nmagnetization state of HgCr2O4 under an external magnetic field, H. When the\nfield is applied in its Neel ground state, a phase transition occurs at H ~ 10\nTesla at which each tetrahedron changes from a canted Neel state to a\nfractional spin state with the total spin, Stet, of S/2 and the lattice\nundergoes orthorhombic to cubic symmetry change. Our results provide the\nmicroscopic one-to-one correspondence between the spin state and the lattice\ndistortion.\n	10.1038/nphys586	cond-mat.str-el	\N
383	0707.0305	The Quasar Accretion Disk Size - Black Hole Mass Relation	2007-07-02	\N	\N	  We use the microlensing variability observed for nine gravitationally lensed\nquasars to show that the accretion disk size at 2500 Angstroms is related to\nthe black hole mass by log(R_2500/cm) = (15.6+-0.2) +\n(0.54+-0.28)log(M_BH/10^9M_sun). This scaling is consistent with the\nexpectation from thin disk theory (R ~ M_BH^(2/3)), but it implies that black\nholes radiate with relatively low efficiency, log(eta) = -1.29+-0.44 +\nlog(L/L_E) where eta=L/(Mdot c^2). These sizes are also larger, by a factor of\n~3, than the size needed to produce the observed 0.8 micron quasar flux by\nthermal radiation from a thin disk with the same T ~ R^(-3/4) temperature\nprofile. More sophisticated disk models are clearly required, particularly as\nour continuing observations improve the precision of the measurements and yield\nestimates of the scaling with wavelength and accretion rate.\n	10.1088/0004-637X/712/2/1129	astro-ph	5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJL

Bell's Concept of Local Causality	2007-07-03	2011-03-10	American Journal of Physics, 79, 1261 (2011)	  John Stewart Bell's famous 1964 theorem is widely regarded as one of the most\nimportant developments in the foundations of physics. It has even been\ndescribed as "the most profound discovery of science." Yet even as we approach\nthe 50th anniversary of Bell's discovery, its meaning and implications remain\ncontroversial. Many textbooks and commentators report that Bell's theorem\nrefutes the possibility (suggested especially by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen\nin 1935) of supplementing ordinary quantum theory with additional ("hidden")\nvariables that might restore determinism and/or some notion of an\nobserver-independent reality. On this view, Bell's theorem supports the\northodox Copenhagen interpretation. Bell's own view of his theorem, however,\nwas quite different. He instead took the theorem as establishing an "essential\nconflict" between the now well-tested empirical predictions of quantum theory\nand relativistic \\emph{local causality}. The goal of the present paper is, in\ngeneral, to make Bell's own views more widely known and, in particular, to\nexplain in detail Bell's little-known mathematical formulation of the concept\nof relativistic local causality on which his theorem rests. We thus collect and\norganize many of Bell's crucial statements on these topics, which are scattered\nthroughout his writings, into a self-contained, pedagogical discussion\nincluding elaborations of the concepts "beable", "completeness", and\n"causality" which figure in the formulation. We also show how local causality\n(as formulated by Bell) can be used to derive an empirically testable Bell-type\ninequality, and how it can be used to recapitulate the EPR argument.\n	10.1119/1.3630940	quant-ph	19 pages, 4 figures

A 76, 063616 (2007)	  In ultracold gases many experiments use atom imaging as a basic observable.\nThe resulting image is averaged over a number of realizations and mostly only\nthis average is used. Only recently the noise has been measured to extract\nphysical information. In the present paper we investigate the quantum noise\narising in these gases at zero temperature. We restrict ourselves to the\nhomogeneous situation and study the fluctuations in particle number found\nwithin a given volume in the gas, and more specifically inside a sphere of\nradius $R$. We show that zero-temperature fluctuations are not extensive and\nthe leading term scales with sphere radius $R$ as $R^2\\ln R$ (or $\\ln R$) in\nthree- (or one-) dimensional systems. We calculate systematically the next term\nbeyond this leading order. We consider first the generic case of a compressible\nsuperfluid. Then we investigate the whole Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC)-BCS\ncrossover crossover, and in particular the limiting cases of the weakly\ninteracting Bose gas and of the free Fermi gas.\n	10.1103/PhysRevA.76.063616	cond-mat.stat-mech	Minor changes due to referee comments

In this report, phase\nreferencing with VSOP-2 is examined in detail based on a simulation tool called\nARIS. The criterion for successful phase referencing was to keep the phase\nerrors below one radian. Simulations with ARIS reveal that phase referencing\nachieves good performance at 8.4GHz, even under poor tropospheric conditions.\nAt 22 and 43GHz, it is recommended to conduct phase referencing observations\nunder good or typical tropospheric conditions. The satellite is required to\nhave an attitude-switching capability with a one-minute or shorter cycle, and\nan orbit determination accuracy higher than about 10cm at apogee; the phase\nreferencing calibrators are required to have a signal-to-noise ratio larger\nthan four for a single scan. The probability to find a suitable phase\nreferencing calibrator was estimated by using VLBI surveys. From the viewpoint\nof calibrator availability, VSOP-2 phase referencing at 8.4GHz is promising.\nHowever, the change of finding suitable calibrators at 22 and 43GHz is\nsignificantly reduced; it is important to conduct specific investigations for\neach target at those frequencies.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.2.397	astro-ph	about 30 pages, 18 figures

We theoretically study the limitations of this\ntechnique. At low modulation frequency, we show that the longitudinal potential\nmodulation produces a heating of the cloud and we compute the heating rate. We\nalso give a quantum derivation of the rough conservative potential associated\nwith the micro-motion of the atoms. At large modulation frequency, we compute\nthe loss rate due to non adiabatic spin flip and show it presents resonnances\nat multiple modulation frequencies.

Japan 59 (2007) 857-867	  We employed a sample compiled by Norris et al. (2005, ApJ, 625, 324) to study\nthe dependence of the pulse temporal properties on energy in long-lag,\nwide-pulse gamma-ray bursts. Our analysis shows that the pulse peak time, rise\ntime scale and decay time scale are power law functions of energy, which is a\npreliminary report on the relationships between the three quantities and\nenergy. The power law indexes associated with the pulse width, rise time scale\nand decay time scale are correlated and the correlation between the indexes\nassociated with the pulse width and the decay time scale is more obvious. In\naddition, we have found that the pulse peak lag is strongly correlated with the\nCCF lag, but the centroid lag is less correlated with the peak lag and CCF lag.\nBased on these results and some previous investigations, we tend to believe\nthat all energy-dependent pulse temporal properties may come from the joint\ncontribution of both the hydrodynamic processes of the outflows and the\ncurvature effect, where the energy-dependent spectral lag may be mainly\ndominated by the dynamic process and the energy-dependent pulse width may be\nmainly determined by the curvature effect.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.4.857	astro-ph	20 pages, 7 figures, added references, matched to published version,\n  accepted for publication in PASJ

For intuitionistic logic, the axioms of the equivalent\nHilbert-style logic can be propositions which are also known as the types of\nthe combinators I, K and S. Hilbert-style versions of illative combinatory\nlogic have formulations with axioms that are actual type statements for I, K\nand S. As pure type systems (PTSs)are, in a sense, equivalent to systems of\nillative combinatory logic, it might be thought that Hilbert-style PTSs (HPTSs)\ncould be based in a similar way. This paper shows that some PTSs have very\ntrivial equivalent HPTSs, with only the axioms as theorems and that for many\nPTSs no equivalent HPTS can exist. Most commonly used PTSs belong to these two\nclasses. For some PTSs however, including lambda* and the PTS at the basis of\nthe proof assistant Coq, there is a nontrivial equivalent HPTS, with axioms\nthat are type statements for I, K and S.\n	10.2168/LMCS-4(1:1)2008	cs.LO	Accepted in Logical Methods in Computer Science

Special Topics 151, 41 (2007)	  When a physical system is put in contact with a very large thermal bath, it\nundergoes a dissipative (i.e., an apparently irreversible) process that leads\nto thermal equilibrium. This dynamical process can be described fully within\nquantum physics, involving only unitary, therefore reversible, maps. The\ninformation, initially present in the system, is not erased, but is diluted in\nthe bath because of entanglement. Irreversibility may arise if, after quantum\ninformation has been thus diluted, some classical information is lost. This\npaper reviews a model for thermalization that displays these features. Two new\nanalytical results are provided for the zero-temperature channels: a new\nquantitative measure of entanglement, and a study of irreversibility in the\ncase where the lost classical information is the label of the particles in the\nbath.\n	10.1140/epjst/e2007-00360-y	quant-ph	To appear in EPJST, Proceedings of "Thermal Transport and Relaxation:\n  Foundation and Perspectives" (Bad Honnef, January 2007)

The mapped area is -1.000 < l < 1.625 deg, -0.375 < b\n< +0.250 deg. The kinetic temperatures derived from the (2,2) to (1,1)\nintensity ratios are 20--80 K or exceed 80 K. The gases corresponding to\ntemperature of 20--80 K and > 80 K contain 75% and 25% of the total NH3 flux,\nrespectively. These temperatures indicate that the dense molecular gas in the\nCMZ is dominated by gas that is warmer than the majority of the dust present\nthere. A comparison with the CO survey by Sawada et al. (2001) shows that the\nNH3 emitting region is surrounded by a high pressure region on the l-v plane.\nAlthough NH3 emission traces dense gas, it is not extended into a high pressure\nregion. Therefore, the high pressure region is less dense and has to be hotter.\nThis indicates that the molecular cloud complex in the Galactic center region\nhas a ``core'' of dense and warm clouds which are traced by the NH3 emission,\nand an ``envelope'' of less dense and hotter gas clouds.

The novel cancellations necessary for ultraviolet\nfiniteness first appear at one loop in the guise of the "no-triangle\nhypothesis". We study one-loop amplitudes in pure Einstein gravity and point\nout the existence of cancellations similar to those found previously in N=8\nsupergravity. These cancellations go beyond those found in the one-loop\neffective action. Using unitarity, this suggests that generic theories of\nquantum gravity based on the Einstein-Hilbert action may be better behaved in\nthe ultraviolet at higher loops than suggested by naive power counting, though\nwithout additional (supersymmetric) cancellations they diverge.

They combine the small length-scale resolution of molecular dynamics\n(MD) with the ability to simulate dynamics on mesoscopic time scales. We show\nhow PFC can be interpreted as the result of applying coarse-graining in time to\nthe microscopic density field of molecular dynamics simulations. We take the\nform of the free energy for the phase field from the classical density\nfunctional theory of inhomogeneous liquids and then choose coefficients to\nmatch the structure factor of the time coarse-grained microscopic density\nfield. As an example, we show how to construct a PFC free energy for Weber and\nStillinger's two-dimensional square crystal potential which models a system of\nproteins suspended in a membrane.\n	10.1209/0295-5075/81/40007	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	5 pages, 4 figures, typos corrected, more explanation in parts,\n  equilib vs non-equilib clarified

A waterfall effect is deemed to assist the process of\npotential-difference output-switch into diverse logic states in quantum dot\ncomputational methods via utilizing coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) and carbon\nnanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs). A 'quantum confinement' is thus\nderived for a flow of particles in a categorized quantum well substrate with a\nnormalized capacitance rectifying high B-field flux into electromagnetic\ninduction. Multi-access of coherent sequences of 'qubit addressing' is gained\nin any magnitude as pre-defined for the orientation of array displacement.\nBriefly, Gaussian curvature of k<0 is debated in aim of specifying the 2D\nelectron gas characteristics in scenarios where data is stored in short\nintervals versus long ones e.g. when k'>(k<0) for greater CCNT diameters,\nspace-time continuum is folded by chance for the particle.

411	0707.1436	The collective dynamics of self-propelled particles	2007-07-10	\N	\N	  We have proposed a method for the dynamic simulation of a collection of\nself-propelled particles in a viscous Newtonian fluid. We restrict attention to\nparticles whose size and velocity are small enough that the fluid motion is in\nthe creeping flow regime. We have proposed a simple model for a self-propelled\nparticle, and extended the Stokesian Dynamics method to conduct dynamic\nsimulations of a collection of such particles. In our description, each\nparticle is treated as a sphere with an orientation vector $\\te{p}$, whose\nlocomotion is driven by the action of a force dipole at a point slightly\ndisplaced from its centre. In isolation, a self-propelled particle moves at a\nconstant speed in the direction of $\\te{p}$. When it coexists with many such\nparticles, its hydrodynamic interaction with the other particles alters its\nvelocity and, more importantly, its orientation. As a result, the motion of the\nparticle is chaotic. Our simulations are not restricted to low particle\nconcentration, as we implement the full hydrodynamic interactions between the\nparticles, but we restrict the motion of particles to two dimensions to reduce\ncomputation. We report the statistical properties of a suspension of\nself-propelled particles, such as the distribution of particle velocity, the\npair correlation function and the orientation correlation function, for a range\nof the particle concentration.\n	10.1017/S0022112007009184	cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech	25 pages, 19 figures, under review in J.

Our approach is based on a Ginzburg-Landau-like model of\nelectromagnetic dark energy, where gravitationally active photons obtain mass\nin the superconductor.

420	0707.1910	Dispersive, superfluid-like shock waves in nonlinear optics	2007-07-12	\N	Nature Physics 3, 46 (2007)	  In most classical fluids, shock waves are strongly dissipative, their energy\nbeing quickly lost through viscous damping. But in systems such as cold\nplasmas, superfluids, and Bose-Einstein condensates, where viscosity is\nnegligible or non-existent, a fundamentally different type of shock wave can\nemerge whose behaviour is dominated by dispersion rather than dissipation.\nDispersive shock waves are difficult to study experimentally, and analytical\nsolutions to the equations that govern them have only been found in one\ndimension (1D). By exploiting a well-known, but little appreciated,\ncorrespondence between the behaviour of superfluids and nonlinear optical\nmaterials, we demonstrate an all-optical experimental platform for studying the\ndynamics of dispersive shock waves. This enables us to observe the propagation\nand nonlinear response of dispersive shock waves, including the interaction of\ncolliding shock waves, in 1D and 2D. Our system offers a versatile and more\naccessible means for exploring superfluid-like and related dispersive\nphenomena.\n	10.1038/nphys486	physics.optics cond-mat.other physics.flu-dyn	21 pages, 6 figures Revised abstract

To\nestimate the size of the resultant disturbances, credible predictions of\ncharging rates and the charging noise are required. Using the GEANT4 software\ntoolkit, we present a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the ASTROD I test mass\ncharging due to exposure of the spacecraft to galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) protons\nand alpha particles (3He, 4He) in the space environment. A positive charging\nrate of 33.3 e+/s at solar minimum is obtained. This figure reduces by 50% at\nsolar maximum. Based on this charging rate and factoring in the contribution of\nminor cosmic-ray components, we calculate the acceleration noise and stiffness\nassociated with charging. We conclude that the acceleration noise arising from\nCoulomb and Lorentz effects are well below the ASTROD I acceleration noise\nlimit at 0.1 mHz both at solar minimum and maximum. The coherent Fourier\ncomponents due to charging are investigated, it needs to be studied carefully\nin order to ensure that these do not compromise the quality of science data in\nthe ASTROD I mission.\n	10.1142/S0218271808012632	astro-ph	20 pages, 14 figures, submitted to International Journal of Modern\n  Physics D

The Cauchy horizon forming colliding wave solution due to Chandrasekhar and\nXanthopoulos (CX) has been generalized by inclusion of the NUT (Newman - Unti -\nTamburino) parameter.

By taking appropriate combination of Killing vectors and analytically\nextending beyond the Cauchy horizon the time-like hyperbolic sigularities are\nresolved as well. This provides another example of its kind among the type - D\nmetrics with special emphasis on the role of the NUT parameter. Finally, it is\nshown that horizons of colliding higher dimensional plane waves obtained from\nthe black p-branes undergoes a similar procedure of analytic extension.\n	10.1142/S0217751X09044243	gr-qc	26 pages. 3 ps figures

424	0707.2021	On-Shell Description of Unsteady Flames	2007-07-13	2008-01-23	\N	  The problem of non-perturbative description of unsteady premixed flames with\narbitrary gas expansion is solved in the two-dimensional case. Considering the\nflame as a surface of discontinuity with arbitrary local burning rate and gas\nvelocity jumps given on it, we show that the front dynamics can be determined\nwithout having to solve the flow equations in the bulk. On the basis of the\nThomson circulation theorem, an implicit integral representation of the gas\nvelocity downstream is constructed. It is then simplified by a successive\nstripping of the potential contributions to obtain an explicit expression for\nthe vortex component near the flame front. We prove that the unknown potential\ncomponent is left bounded and divergence-free by this procedure, and hence can\nbe eliminated using the dispersion relation for its on-shell value (i.e., the\nvalue along the flame front). The resulting system of integro-differential\nequations relates the on-shell fuel velocity and the front position. As\nlimiting cases, these equations contain all theoretical results on flame\ndynamics established so far, including the linear equation describing the\nDarrieus-Landau instability of planar flames, and the nonlinear\nSivashinsky-Clavin equation for flames with weak gas expansion.\n	10.1017/S0022112008002140	physics.flu-dyn	21 pages, 3 figures; extended discussion of causality, new references\n  added

For a canonical system, we\ndiscuss the dependence of this intermittency on the Power Spectrum Density\n(PSD) of the noise. Our study is based on the calculation of the Probability\nDensity Function (PDF) of the unstable variable. We derive analytical results\nfor some particular types of noises and interpret them in the framework of\non-off intermittency. Besides, we perform a cumulant expansion for a random\nnoise with arbitrary power spectrum density and show that the intermittent\nregime is controlled by the ratio between the departure from the threshold and\nthe value of the PSD of the noise at zero frequency. Our results are in\nagreement with numerical simulations performed with two types of random\nperturbations: colored Gaussian noise and deterministic fluctuations of a\nchaotic variable.

The mass of the inner\nenvelope detected by the dust continuum emission is about 0.02 Msun. The H2CO\nspectrum at the protostellar position shows a blue-skewed double peak profile,\nsuggesting that the kinematics of the inner envelope is dominated by infall\nmotion. When the blueshifted and the redshifted peaks were imaged separately,\nhowever, there is a small east-west displacement between the maximum positions.\nThis displacement suggests that some part of the H2CO emission might come from\nthe outflowing gas. A combined effect of the infalling envelope and the outflow\non the radiative transfer is discussed. This effect can make the line profile\nasymmetry severer than what is expected from infall-only models.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.5.L41	astro-ph	\N

This is investigated for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model\nwith long ranged interactions. In particular, the time dependent local field\ndistribution and energy are calculated for zero temperature. This is done for a\nsystem quenched to zero temperature, slow cooling or simulated annealing, a\ngreedy algorithm and repeated tapping. Results are obtained from Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and a Master-Fokker-Planck approach. A comparison with replica\nsymmetry broken theory, evaluated in high orders, shows that the energies\nobtained via dynamics are higher than the ground state energy of replica\ntheory. Tapping and simulated annealing yield on the other hand results which\nare very close to the ground state energy. The local field distribution tends\nto zero for small fields. This is in contrast to the Edwards flat measure\nhypothesis. The distribution of energies obtained for different tapping\nstrengths does again not follow the canonical form proposed by Edwards.\n	10.1140/epjb/e2008-00017-1	cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech	Minor changes and journal reference added. 10 pages 6 figures

Excluded volume\ninteractions between the two components are modeled by stochastic multiparticle\ncollisions which depend on the local velocities and densities. Momentum and\nenergy are conserved locally, and entropically driven phase separation occurs\nfor high collision rates.

Res. 113, A05103 (2008)	  This paper studies the turbulent cascade of magnetic energy in weakly\ncollisional magnetized plasmas. A cascade model is presented, based on the\nassumptions of local nonlinear energy transfer in wavenumber space, critical\nbalance between linear propagation and nonlinear interaction times, and the\napplicability of linear dissipation rates for the nonlinearly turbulent plasma.\nThe model follows the nonlinear cascade of energy from the driving scale in the\nMHD regime, through the transition at the ion Larmor radius into the kinetic\nAlfven wave regime, in which the turbulence is dissipated by kinetic processes.\nThe turbulent fluctuations remain at frequencies below the ion cyclotron\nfrequency due to the strong anisotropy of the turbulent fluctuations,\nk_parallel << k_perp (implied by critical balance). In this limit, the\nturbulence is optimally described by gyrokinetics; it is shown that the\ngyrokinetic approximation is well satisfied for typical slow solar wind\nparameters. Wave phase velocity measurements are consistent with a kinetic\nAlfven wave cascade and not the onset of ion cyclotron damping. The conditions\nunder which the gyrokinetic cascade reaches the ion cyclotron frequency are\nestablished. Cascade model solutions imply that collisionless damping provides\na natural explanation for the observed range of spectral indices in the\ndissipation range of the solar wind. The dissipation range spectrum is\npredicted to be an exponential fall off; the power-law behavior apparent in\nobservations may be an artifact of limited instrumental sensitivity. The\ncascade model is motivated by a programme of gyrokinetic simulations of\nturbulence and particle heating in the solar wind.\n	10.1029/2007JA012665	astro-ph	29 pages, 14 figures

It is based on\ngeneral notions of sequential computational strategies and wittingly consistent\nnon-deterministic strategies introduced by the author in the seventies.\nAlthough these notions of strategies are old, the definition of the fully\nabstract models is new, in that it is given level-by-level in the finite type\nhierarchy. To prove full abstraction and non-dcpo domain theoretic properties\nof these models, a theory of computational strategies is developed. This is\nalso an alternative and, in a sense, an analogue to the later game strategy\nsemantics approaches of Abramsky, Jagadeesan, and Malacaria; Hyland and Ong;\nand Nickau. In both cases of PCF and PCF^+ there are definable universal\n(surjective) functionals from numerical functions to any given type,\nrespectively, which also makes each of these models unique up to isomorphism.\nAlthough such models are non-omega-complete and therefore not continuous in the\ntraditional terminology, they are also proved to be sequentially complete (a\nweakened form of omega-completeness), "naturally" continuous (with respect to\nexisting directed "pointwise", or "natural" lubs) and also "naturally"\nomega-algebraic and "naturally" bounded complete -- appropriate generalisation\nof the ordinary notions of domain theory to the case of non-dcpos.\n	10.2168/LMCS-3(3:7)2007	cs.LO	50 pages

It is found that the effect of the resonant lock on\nthe velocities is rather small, while on the rates more substantial. The\ncollisional rates between objects in an external resonance are by about a\nfactor of two higher than those in a similar belt of objects not locked in a\nresonance. For Trojans under the same conditions, the collisional rates may be\nenhanced by up to an order of magnitude.

455	0707.3619	Semi-local string comparison: algorithmic techniques and applications	2007-07-24	2013-11-23	\N	  A classical measure of string comparison is given by the longest common\nsubsequence (LCS) problem on a pair of strings. We consider its generalisation,\ncalled the semi-local LCS problem, which arises naturally in many\nstring-related problems. The semi-local LCS problem asks for the LCS scores for\neach of the input strings against every substring of the other input string,\nand for every prefix of each input string against every suffix of the other\ninput string. Such a comparison pattern provides a much more detailed picture\nof string similarity than a single LCS score; it also arises naturally in many\nstring-related problems. In fact, the semi-local LCS problem turns out to be\nfundamental for string comparison, providing a powerful and flexible\nalternative to classical dynamic programming. It is especially useful when the\ninput to a string comparison problem may not be available all at once: for\nexample, comparison of dynamically changing strings; comparison of compressed\nstrings; parallel string comparison. The same approach can also be applied to\npermutation strings, providing efficient solutions for local versions of the\nlongest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem, and for the problem of computing\na maximum clique in a circle graph. Furthermore, the semi-local LCS problem\nturns out to have surprising connections in a few seemingly unrelated fields,\nsuch as computational geometry and algebra of semigroups. This work is devoted\nto exploring the structure of the semi-local LCS problem, its efficient\nsolutions, and its applications in string comparison and other related areas,\nincluding computational molecular biology.\n	\N	cs.DS cs.DM	\N

B 76, 014429 (2007)	  The structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Co$_n$ clusters\n($n=2-$20) have been investigated using density functional theory within the\npseudopotential plane wave method. An unusual hexagonal growth pattern has been\nobserved in the intermediate size range, $n=15-$20.

We secondly show collisions between the outer Galactic HI disk and\nthe LAs of the MS can create giant HI holes and chimney-like structures in the\ndisk about 0.2 Gyr ago. We thirdly show that a large amount of metal-poor gas\nis stripped from the SMC and transfered to the LMC during the tidal interaction\nbetween the Clouds and the Galaxy about 0.2 and 1.3 Gyr ago. We thus propose\nthat this metal-poor gas can closely be associated with the origin of LMC's\nyoung and intermediate-age stars and star clusters with distinctively\nlow-metallicities with [Fe/H] < -0.6.\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_55	astro-ph	4 pages, 3 figures, to appear in the proceedings of ``Galaxies in the\n  Local Volume'', Sydney, 8 to 13 July, 2007

471	0708.0057	Effects of Compton scattering on the Gamma Ray Spectra of Solar flares	2007-07-31	\N	\N	  Using fully relativistic GEANT4 simulation tool kit, the transport of\nenergetic electrons generated in solar flares was Monte-Carlo simulated, and\nresultant bremsstrahlung gamma-ray spectra were calculated. The solar\natmosphere was approximated by 10 vertically-stacked zones. The simulation took\ninto account two important physical processes,that the bremsstrahlung photons\nemitted by precipitating relativistic electrons are strongly forward beamed\ntoward the photosphere, and that the majority of these gamma-rays must be\nCompton back-scattered by the solar atmosphere in order to reach the observer.\nThen, the Compton degradation was found to make the observable gamma-ray\nspectra much softer than is predicted by simple analytic calculations. The\ngamma-ray signals were found to be enhanced by several conditions, including a\nbroad pitch-angle distribution of the electrons, a near-limb flare longitude,\nand a significant tilt in the magnetic field lines if the flare longitude is\nrather small. These results successfully explain several important flare\nproperties observed in the hard X-ray to gamma-ray range, including in\nparticular those obtained with Yohkoh. A comparison of the Yohkoh spectrum from\na GOES X3.7 class limb flare on 1998 November 22, with a simulation assuming a\nbroad electron pitch-angle distribution, suggests that gamma-rays from this\nparticular solar flare were a mixture of direct bremsstrahlung photons and\ntheir Comptonization.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.6.1161	astro-ph	37 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ

476	0708.0230	Imaging spontaneous currents in superconducting arrays of pi-junctions	2007-08-01	\N	\N	  Superconductors separated by a thin tunneling barrier exhibit the Josephson\neffect that allows charge transport at zero voltage, typically with no phase\nshift between the superconductors in the lowest energy state. Recently,\nJosephson junctions with ground state phase shifts of pi proposed by theory\nthree decades ago have been demonstrated. In superconducting loops,\npi-junctions cause spontaneous circulation of persistent currents in zero\nmagnetic field, analogous to spin-1/2 systems. Here we image the spontaneous\nzero-field currents in superconducting networks of temperature-controlled\npi-junctions with weakly ferromagnetic barriers using a scanning SQUID\nmicroscope. We find an onset of spontaneous supercurrents at the 0-pi\ntransition temperature of the junctions Tpi = 3 K. We image the currents in\nnon-uniformly frustrated arrays consisting of cells with even and odd numbers\nof pi-junctions. Such arrays are attractive model systems for studying the\nexotic phases of the 2D XY-model and achieving scalable adiabatic quantum\ncomputers.\n	10.1038/nphys780	cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.mes-hall	Pre-referee version.

480	0708.0270	Solar cycle variation of real CME latitudes	2007-08-02	\N	\N	  With the assumption of radial motion and uniform longitudinal distribution of\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs), we propose a method to eliminate projection\neffects from the apparent observed CME latitude distribution. This method has\nbeen applied to SOHO LASCO data from 1996 January to 2006 December. As a\nresult, we find that the real CME latitude distribution had the following\ncharacteristics: (1) High-latitude CMEs ($\\theta>60^{\\circ}$ where $\\theta$ is\nthe latitude) constituted 3% of all CMEs and mainly occurred during the time\nwhen the polar magnetic fields reversed sign. The latitudinal drift of the\nhigh-latitude CMEs was correlated with that of the heliospheric current sheet.\n(2) 4% of all CMEs occurred in the range $45^{\\circ}\\leq\\theta\\leq60^{\\circ}$.\nThese mid-latitude CMEs occurred primarily in 2000, near the middle of 2002 and\nin 2005, respectively, forming a prominent three-peak structure; (3) The\nhighest occurrence probability of low-latitude ($\\theta< 45^{\\circ}$) CMEs was\nat the minimum and during the declining phase of the solar cycle. However, the\nhighest occurrence rate of low-latitude CMEs was at the maximum and during the\ndeclining phase of the solar cycle. The latitudinal evolution of low-latitude\nCMEs did not follow the Sp\\"{o}rer sunspot law, which suggests that many CMEs\noriginated outside of active regions.\n	10.1086/522032	astro-ph	4 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ApJ Letter

482	0708.0389	Hydrogen patterning of Ga1-xMnxAs for planar spintronics	2007-08-02	\N	\N	  We demonstrate two patterning techniques based on hydrogen passivation of\nGa1-xMnxAs to produce isolated ferromagnetically active regions embedded\nuniformly in a paramagnetic, insulating host. The first method consists of\nselective hydrogenation of Ga1-xMnxAs by lithographic masking. Magnetotransport\nmeasurements of Hall-bars made in this manner display the characteristic\nproperties of the hole-mediated ferromagnetic phase, which result from good\npattern isolation. Arrays of Ga1-xMnxAs dots as small as 250 nm across have\nbeen realized by this process. The second process consists of blanket\nhydrogenation of Ga1-xMnxAs followed by local reactivation using confined\nlow-power pulsed-laser annealing. Conductance imaging reveals local electrical\nreactivation of micrometer-sized regions that accompanies the restoration of\nferromagnetism. The spatial resolution achievable with this method can\npotentially reach <100 nm by employing near-field laser processing. The high\nspatial resolution attainable by hydrogenation patterning enables the\ndevelopment of systems with novel functionalities such as lateral\nspin-injection as well as the exploration of magnetization dynamics in\nindividual and coupled structures made from this novel class of semiconductors.\n	10.1016/j.physb.2007.08.208	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	ICDS-24, July 2007. 8 pages with 4 figures

The characteristic range of nonlocality,\nset by the spin diffusion length, can be large enough to allow detection of\nthis effect in materials such as GaAs despite its small magnitude.

487	0708.0753	The Baryonic and Dark Matter Properties of High Redshift Gravitationally\n  Lensed Disk Galaxies	2007-08-06	\N	\N	  We present a detailed study of the structural properties of four\ngravitationally lensed disk galaxies at z=1. Modelling the rotation curves on\nsub-kpc scales we derive the values for the disk mass, the reference dark\nmatter density and core radius, and the angular momentum per unit mass. The\nderived models suggest that the rotation curve profile and amplitude are best\nfit with a dark matter component similar to those of local spiral galaxies. The\nstellar component also has a similar length scale, but with substantially\nsmaller masses than similarly luminous disk galaxies in the local universe.\nComparing the average dark matter density inside the optical radius we find\nthat the disk galaxies at z=1 have larger densities (by up to a factor of 7)\nthan similar disk galaxies in the local Universe. Furthermore, the angular\nmomentum per unit mass versus reference velocity is well matched to the local\nrelation, suggesting that the angular momentum of the disk remains constant\nbetween high redshifts and the present day.

This box can be either a metallic box or a finite size\nquantum wire.The formation of the Kondo screening cloud in the box strongly\ndepends on the ratio between the Kondo temperature and the box level spacing.\nBy weakly connecting two metallic reservoirs to the quantum dot, a detailed\nspectroscopic analysis can be performed. Since the transport channels and the\nscreening channels are almost decoupled, such a setup allows an easier access\nto the measure of finite-size effects associated with the finite extension of\nthe Kondo cloud.\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-8512-3_12	cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.str-el	contribution to Les Houches proceeding, ``Quantum magnetism'' 2006

Scripta T 140, 014059 (2010)	  Given a finite number of copies of an unknown qubit state that have already\nbeen measured optimally, can one still extract any information about the\noriginal unknown state? We give a positive answer to this question and quantify\nthe information obtainable by a given observer as a function of the number of\ncopies in the ensemble, and of the number of independent observers that, one\nafter the other, have independently measured the same ensemble of qubits before\nhim. The optimality of the protocol is proven and extensions to other states\nand encodings are also studied. According to the general lore, the state after\na measurement has no information about the state before the measurement. Our\nresults manifestly show that this statement has to be taken with a grain of\nsalt, specially in situations where the quantum states encode confidential\ninformation.\n	10.1088/0031-8949/2010/T140/014059	quant-ph	4 pages
490	0708.1093	Nuclear Star Clusters across the Hubble Sequence	2007-08-08	\N	\N	  Over the last decade, HST imaging studies have revealed that the centers of\nmost galaxies are occupied by compact, barely resolved sources. Based on their\nstructural properties, position in the fundamental plane, and spectra, these\nsources clearly have a stellar origin. They are therefore called ``nuclear star\nclusters'' (NCs) or ``stellar nuclei''. NCs are found in galaxies of all Hubble\ntypes, suggesting that their formation is intricately linked to galaxy\nevolution. In this contribution, I briefly review the results from recent\nstudies of NCs, touch on some ideas for their formation, and mention some open\nissues related to the possible connection between NCs and supermassive black\nholes.\n	10.1007/978-90-481-3400-7_19	astro-ph	6 page conference proceedings, to appear in "The impact of HST on\n  European Astronomy" (41st ESLAB Symposium), pdflatex file, uses svmult.cls\n  (included)

Instead, the local magnetic moments remain disordered down to the\nlowest measured temperature. To get more insight into this phenomenon, we have\nperformed first principles calculations of the first, second end third\nneighbors exchange interactions, and found that the second neighbor exchange is\nnegligible, while the first and the third neighbor exchanges are comparable and\nantiferromagnetic.

Internal dissipation below a photosphere can create a radiation-dominated\nthermal fireball. If electron-positron pairs outnumber protons, radiative\nacceleration of pairs drives the two-stream instabilities between pairs and\nprotons, leading to the ``proton sedimentation'' in the accelerating pair\nframe. Pairs are continuously shock heated by proton clumps, scattering the\nthermal photons into the broken power-law shape, with the non-thermal energy\nthat is comparable to the proton kinetic energy, consistent with observations.\nPair photospheres become unstable around the radius of the progenitor star\nwhere strong thermalization occurs, if parameters satisfy the observed spectral\n(Yonetoku) relation.

497	0708.1522	Electron Thermal Microscopy	2007-08-10	2007-08-20	\N	  The progress of semiconductor electronics toward ever-smaller length scales\nand associated higher power densities brings a need for new high-resolution\nthermal microscopy techniques. Traditional thermal microscopy is performed by\ndetecting infrared radiation with far-field optics, where the resolution is\nlimited by the wavelength of the light. By adopting a serial, local-probe\napproach, near-field and scanned-probe microscopies can surpass this limit but\nsacrifice imaging speed. In the same way that electron microscopy was invented\nto overcome the resolution limits of light microscopy, we here demonstrate a\nthermal imaging technique that uses an electron microscope to overcome the\nlimits of infrared thermal microscopy, without compromising imaging speed. With\nthis new technique, which we call electron thermal microscopy, temperature is\nresolved by detecting the liquid-solid transition of arrays of nanoscale\nislands, producing thermal maps in real-time (30 thermal images per second over\na 16um^2 field-of-view). The experimental demonstration is supported by\ncombined electrical and thermal modeling.\n	10.1021/nl0729375	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	1 PDF file, incl. 17 pages manuscript plus 6 pages Supplementary\n  Discussion v2: Add corresponding author asterisk and acknowledgement
498	0708.1553	Single top production associated with a neutral scalar at LHC in\n  topcolor-assisted technicolor	2007-08-11	\N	\N	  The topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) model predicts a number of neutral\nscalars like the top-pion ($\\pi^0_t$) and the top-Higgs ($h^0_t$). These\nscalars have flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) top quark couplings, among\nwhich the top-charm transition couplings may be sizable. Such FCNC couplings\ninduce single top productions associated with a neutral scalar at the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) through the parton processes $cg \\to t \\pi_t^0$ and\n$cg \\to t h_t^0$. In this note we examine these productions and find their\nproduction rates can exceed the $3\\sigma$ sensitivity of the LHC in a large\npart of parameter space. Since in the Standard Model and the minimal\nsupersymmetric model such rare productions have unobservably small production\nrates at the LHC, these rare processes will serve as a good probe for the TC2\nmodel.\n	10.1088/1674-1137/32/9/004	hep-ph	7 pages, 3 figs

The first, Law of Kinematic in non-inertial reference\nframes reads: the kinematic state of a body free of forces conserves and\ndeterminates a constant n-th order derivative with respect to time being equal\nin absolute value to an invariant of the observer's reference frame. The\nsecond, Law of Dynamic extended Newton's second law to non-inertial reference\nframes and also contains additional variables there are higher derivatives of\ncoordinates. Dynamics Law in non-inertial reference frames reads: a force\ninduces a change in the kinematic state of the body and is proportional to the\nrate of its change. It is mean that if the kinematic invariant of the reference\nframe is n-th derivative with respect the time, then the dynamics of a body\nbeing affected by the force F is described by the (n+1)-th differential\nequation. The third, Law of Static in non-inertial reference frames reads: the\nsum of all forces acting a body at rest is equal to zero.\n	10.1063/1.3536452	physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph	7 pages, Latex

502	0708.1788	Reionization Bias in High Redshift Quasar Near-Zones	2007-08-13	\N	\N	  Absorption spectra of high redshift quasars exhibit an increasingly thick\nLy-alpha forest towards z~6. However, the interpretation of these spectra is\ncomplicated by the fact that the Ly-alpha optical depth is already large for\nneutral hydrogen fractions in excess of 10^-4, and also because quasars are\nexpected to reside in dense regions of the IGM. We present a model for the\nevolution of the ionization state of the IGM which is applicable to the dense,\nbiased regions around high-redshift quasars as well as more typical regions in\nthe IGM, and combine this with numerical radiative transfer simulations. Our\nmodel is able to simultaneously reproduce the observed Ly-alpha forest opacity\nat 4<z<6, the ionizing photon mean-free-path at z~4 and the rapid evolution of\nhighly ionized near-zone sizes around high-redshift quasars at 5.8<z<6.4. We\nfind that within 5 physical Mpc of a high redshift quasar, the evolution of the\nionization state of the IGM precedes that in more typical regions by around 0.3\nredshift units. More importantly, when combined with the rapid increase in the\nionizing photon mean-free-path expected shortly after overlap, this offset\nresults in an ionizing background near the quasar which exceeds the value in\nthe rest of the IGM by a factor of ~2-3. We further find that in the\npost-overlap phase of reionization the size of the observed quasar near-zones\nis not directly sensitive to the neutral hydrogen fraction of the IGM. Instead,\nthese sizes probe the level of the background ionization rate and the\ntemperature of the surrounding IGM. The observed rapid evolution of the quasar\nnear-zone sizes at 5.8<z<6.4 can thus be explained by the rapid evolution of\nthe ionizing background, which in our model is caused by the completion of\noverlap at the end of reionization by 6<z<7.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12578.x	astro-ph	16 Pages, 9 figures.

503	0708.1792	Radiative Column and Light Curve of X-Ray Binary Pulsars	2007-08-13	\N	\N	  We examine the published light curves (LCs) of 117 X-ray binary pulsars,\nfocusing on the dependence of their light curves on the observed energy bands.\nIt is found that the energy dependence of the LCs appears only when the X-ray\nluminosity is larger than ~ 5 x 10^36 erg/s. Assuming that the behavior of\nlight curve is related to the radiative accretion column on the neutron star\nsurface, this energy threshold can be considered as the observational proof of\nthe accretion column formation proposed by Basko and Sunyaev. Once we can grasp\nthe existence of radiative column, we can also obtain several useful\ninformations on the neutron star properties. As an instance, we perform the\nstatistical analysis of the orientation angle of the magnetic axis, and we find\nthat the inclination angle of magnetic axis should be small in order to explain\nthe observed statistics.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.5.961	astro-ph	13 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ

With the\nhelp of the mechanical coolers, 179 L (26.0 kg) of super-fluid liquid helium\ncan keep the instruments cryogenically cooled for more than 500 days. The\non-orbit performance of the AKARI cryogenics is consistent with the design and\npre-flight test, and the boil-off gas flow rate is as small as 0.32 mg/s.

The far-infrared four-band images reveal fine\nspatial structures of M101, which include global spiral patterns, giant HII\nregions embedded in outer spiral arms, and a bar-like feature crossing the\ncenter. The spectral energy distribution of the whole galaxy shows the presence\nof the cold dust component (18 K) in addition to the warm dust component (55\nK). The distribution of the cold dust is mostly concentrated near the center,\nand exhibits smoothly distributed over the entire extent of the galaxy, whereas\nthe distribution of the warm dust indicates some correlation with the spiral\narms, and has spotty structures such as four distinctive bright spots in the\nouter disk in addition to a bar-like feature near the center tracing the CO\nintensity map. The star-formation activity of the giant HII regions that\nspatially correspond to the former bright spots is found to be significantly\nhigher than that of the rest of the galaxy. The latter warm dust distribution\nimplies that there are significant star-formation activities in the entire bar\nfilled with molecular clouds.

We obtained 7 band images from 7 to 160um with higher\nspatial resolution and higher sensitivities than previous observations. The\nmid-infrared color of the S9W (9um) and L18W (18um) bands shows a systematic\nvariation around the exciting sources. The spatial variation in the\nmid-infrared color suggests that the star-formation in IC4954/4955 is\nprogressing from south-west to north-east. The FIS data also clearly resolve\ntwo nebulae for the first time in the far-infrared. The FIS 4-band data from\n65um to 160um allow us to correctly estimate the total infrared luminosity from\nthe region, which is about one sixth of the energy emitted from the existing\nstellar sources. Five candidates for young stellar objects have been detected\nas point sources for the first time in the 11um image. They are located in the\nred S9W to L18W color regions, suggesting that current star-formation has been\ntriggered by previous star-formation activities. A wide area map of the size of\nabout 1 x 1 (deg^2) around the IC4954/4955 region was created from the AKARI\nmid-infrared all-sky survey data. Together with the HI 21cm data, it suggests a\nlarge hollow structure of a degree scale, on whose edge the IC4954/4955 region\nhas been created, indicating star formation over three generations in largely\ndifferent spatial scales.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp2.S443	astro-ph	23 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ AKARI special\n  issue

I.\n  Model Design and Validation	2007-08-14	\N	\N	  Data assimilation techniques, developed in the last two decades mainly for\nweather prediction, produce better forecasts by taking advantage of both\ntheoretical/numerical models and real-time observations. In this paper, we\nexplore the possibility of applying the data-assimilation techniques known as\n4D-VAR to the prediction of solar flares. We do so in the context of a\ncontinuous version of the classical cellular-automaton-based self-organized\ncritical avalanche models of solar flares introduced by Lu and Hamilton\n(Astrophys. J., 380, L89, 1991). Such models, although a priori far removed\nfrom the physics of magnetic reconnection and magneto-hydrodynamical evolution\nof coronal structures, nonetheless reproduce quite well the observed\nstatistical distribution of flare characteristics. We report here on a large\nset of data assimilation runs on synthetic energy release time series. Our\nresults indicate that, despite the unpredictable (and unobservable) stochastic\nnature of the driving/triggering mechanism within the avalanche model, 4D-VAR\nsucceeds in producing optimal initial conditions that reproduce adequately the\ntime series of energy released by avalanches/flares. This is an essential first\nstep towards forecasting real flares.\n	10.1007/s11207-007-9009-3	astro-ph	26 pages, 8 figures. Accepted in Solar Physics

As is well-know, a moving quantum\nobject passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum\ncomputer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed\nduality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may\noffer additional computing power \\cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer\nis a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer\noffers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming\nout of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show\nthat an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum\ncomputer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary.\nA $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical\ncomputer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit\nquantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical\ncomputer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing\nand quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which\na quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These\ntwo modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the\nunsorted database search problem is designed.\n	10.1088/0253-6102/50/6/11	quant-ph	4 pages and 3 figures
513	0708.1987	Environmental effect on the subhalo abundance -- a solution to the\n  missing dwarf problem	2007-08-14	2008-05-27	\N	  Recent high-resolution simulations of the formation of dark-matter halos have\nshown that the distribution of subhalos is scale-free, in the sense that if\nscaled by the velocity dispersion of the parent halo, the velocity distribution\nfunction of galaxy-sized and cluster-sized halos are identical. For\ncluster-sized halos, simulation results agreed well with observations.\nSimulations, however, predicted far too many subhalos for galaxy-sized halos.\nOur galaxy has several tens of known dwarf galaxies. On the other hands,\nsimulated dark-matter halos contain thousands of subhalos. We have performed\nsimulation of a single large volume and measured the abundance of subhalos in\nall massive halos. We found that the variation of the subhalo abundance is very\nlarge, and those with largest number of subhalos correspond to simulated halos\nin previous studies. The subhalo abundance depends strongly on the local\ndensity of the background. Halos in high-density regions contain large number\nof subhalos. Our galaxy is in the low-density region. For our simulated halos\nin low-density regions, the number of subhalos is within a factor of three to\nthat of our galaxy. We argue that the ``missing dwarf problem'' is not a real\nproblem but caused by the biased selection of the initial conditions in\nprevious studies, which were not appropriate for field galaxies.\n	10.1093/pasj/60.4.L13	astro-ph	8 pages, 5 figures, higher resolution run added, accepted by PASJ
514	0708.1995	Hybrid single-electron transistor as a source of quantized electric\n  current	2007-08-15	2007-08-16	\N	  The basis of synchronous manipulation of individual electrons in solid-state\ndevices was laid by the rise of single-electronics about two decades ago.\nUltra-small structures in a low temperature environment form an ideal domain of\naddressing electrons one by one. A long-standing challenge in this field has\nbeen the realization of a source of electric current that is accurately related\nto the operation frequency $f$. There is an urgent call for a quantum standard\nof electric current and for the so-called metrological triangle, where voltage\nfrom Josephson effect and resistance from quantum Hall effect are tested\nagainst current via Ohm's law for a consistency check of the fundamental\nconstants of Nature, $\\hbar$ and $e$. Several attempts to create a metrological\ncurrent source that would comply with the demanding criteria of extreme\naccuracy, high yield, and implementation with not too many control parameters\nhave been reported. However, no satisfactory solution exists as yet despite\nmany ingenious achievements that have been witnessed over the years. Here we\npropose and prove the unexpected concept of a hybrid metal-superconductor\nturnstile in the form of a one-island single-electron transistor with one gate,\nwhich demonstrates robust current plateaus at multiple levels of $ef$ within\nthe uncertainty of our current measurement. Our theoretical estimates show that\nthe errors of the present system can be efficiently suppressed by further\noptimizations of design and proper choice of the device parameters and\ntherefore we expect it to eventually meet the stringent specifications of\nquantum metrology.\n	10.1038/nphys808	cond-mat.mes-hall	5 pages, 3 figures

The ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ and\nthe saturation magnetization $M_\\mathrm{s}$ both decrease with substitution. By\npresenting the data in terms of selective dilution, $T_\\mathrm{c}$ in the\nlow-doping region is found to follow the relation\n$T_\\mathrm{c}=T_\\mathrm{c0}(1-n_\\mathrm{p})$, where $T_\\mathrm{c0}$ refers to\nthe undiluted system and $n_\\mathrm{p}$ is the dilution concentration defined\nas $n_\\mathrm{p}=x/0.7$ or $n_\\mathrm{p}=x/0.3$ for $M^\\prime=$ Al or Ti,\nrespectively. The scaling behavior of $T_\\mathrm{c}(n_\\mathrm{p})$ can be\nanalyzed in the framework of the molecular-field theory and still valid when Mn\nis substituted by both Al and Ti. The results are discussed with respect to the\ncontributions from ferromagnetic double exchange and other possible\nantiferromagnetic superexchange interactions coexisting in the material.\n	10.3938/jkps.52.1460	cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.str-el	Revtex4, 4 pages, 4 figures, 2006 Halong Conference Report

We illustrate our approach in a\nvariety of examples for which we obtain several new results with short and\nnon-technical proofs. These examples include the symmetric and asymmetric\nexclusion process and high-temperature spin-flip dynamics ("Glauber dynamics").\nWe also give a new proof of the Poincar\\'e inequality, based on coupling, in\nthe context of one-dimensional Gibbs measures.

M51, as a nearby face-on, grand\ndesign spiral galaxy studied in many line transitions, is an ideal target to\nstudy the connection between physical conditions of the gas and star formation\nactivity. In this contribution we combine molecular, atomic, total gas and\nstellar surface densities and study the gravitational stability of the gas\n(Schuster et al.2007, Hitschfeld et al. in prep.). From our IRAM-30m 12 CO2-1\nmap and complementary HI-, Radio Continuum- and ACS-HST B-band-data we derive\nmaps of the total gas density and the stellar surface density to study the\ngravitational stability of the gas via the Toomre Q parameter.\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_36	astro-ph	4 pages, 3 Figures: Galaxies in the Local Volume, Sydney, Conference\n  Proceedings Contribution

519	0708.2348	Properties of voids in the Local Volume	2007-08-17	\N	\N	  Current explanation of the overabundance of dark matter subhalos in the Local\nGroup (LG) indicates that there maybe a limit on mass of a halo, which can host\na galaxy. This idea can be tested using voids in the distribution of galaxies:\nat some level small voids should not contain any (even dwarf) galaxies. We use\nobservational samples complete to M_B=-12 with distances less than 8 Mpc to\nconstruct the void function (VF): the distribution of sizes of voids empty of\nany galaxies. There are ~ 30 voids with sizes ranging from 1 to 5 Mpc. We also\nstudy the distribution of dark matter halos in very high resolution simulations\nof the LCDM model. The theoretical VF matches the observations remarkably well\nonly if we use halos with circular velocities larger than 45 +/- 10 km/s. This\nagrees with the Local Group predictions. Small voids look quite similar to heir\ngiant cousins: the density has a minimum at the center of a void and it\nincreases as we get closer to the border. Thus, both the Local Group data and\nthe nearby voids indicate that isolated halos below 45 +/- 10 km/s must not\nhost galaxies and that small (few Mpc) voids are truly dark.\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_5	astro-ph	5 pages 1 figure.

At an intermediate noise strength, the noise-induced synchronization\ntakes place most effectively, which is analogous to the stochastic resonance.\nFinally, we study the synchronization of coupled phase oscillators with\nnonvariational interaction on scale-free networks.

524	0708.2530	The Infrared Camera (IRC) deep survey in the performance verification\n  phase	2007-08-19	\N	\N	  We report the first results of a near- and mid- infrared deep survey with the\nInfrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI in the performance verification phase.\nSimultaneous observations by the NIR, MIR-S and MIR-L channels of the IRC with\neffective integration times of 4529, 4908, and 4417 seconds at 3, 7, and 15\nmicron, covering 86.0, 70.3, and 77.3 arcmin^2 area, detected 955, 298 and 277\nsources, respectively. The 5 sigma detection limits of the survey are 6.0, 31.5\nand 71.2 micro Jy and the 50% completeness limit are 24.0, 47.5, and 88.1 micro\nJy at 3, 7, and 15 micron, respectively. The observation is limited by source\nconfusion at 3 micron. We have confirmed the turnover in the 15 micron\ndifferential source counts around 400 micro Jy, previously detected by surveys\nwith the Infrared Space Observatory. The faint end of 15 micron raw source\ncounts agree with the results from the deep surveys in the GOODS fields carried\nout with the Spitzer IRS peak up imager and the predictions of current galaxy\nevolution models.

Using the Large\nBinocular Camera, a purpose-built wide-field imager for the LBT, we have\nexamined the structure and star formation histories of two newly-discovered\nLocal Group members, the Hercules dSph and the Leo T dSph/dIrr system.

We present here the\nMonge-Ampere-Kantorovitch method applied to mock catalogues mimicking in both\nredshift and distance catalogues.

Although internal shocks have been widely discussed as the emission\nsite of GRBs, evidence supporting other emission sites have been also suggested\nrecently, including the closer-in photosphere where the fireball becomes\ntransparent and further-out radii near the fireball deceleration radius where\nmagnetic dissipation may be important. With the successful operation of the\nGLAST experiment, prompt high energy emission spectra from many GRBs would be\ndetected in the near future. We suggest that the cut-off energy of the prompt\nemission spectrum from a GRB depends on both the fireball bulk Lorentz factor\nand the unknown emission radius from the central engine. If the bulk Lorentz\nfactor could be independently measured (e.g. from early afterglow\nobservations), the observed spectral cutoff energy can be used to diagnose the\nemission site of gamma-rays. This would provide valuable information to\nunderstand the physical origin of the GRB promp emission.\n	10.1111/j.1745-3933.2007.00411.x	astro-ph	6 pages,2 figures version to be published in MNRAS Letters

535	0708.2856	Theoretical analysis of magnetic coupling in sandwich clusters\n  V_n(C_6H_6)_{n+1}	2007-08-21	\N	\N	  The mechanism of ferromagnetism stability in sandwich clusters\nV$_n$(C$_6$H$_6$)$_{n+1}$ has been studied by first-principles calculation and\nmodel analysis. It is found that each of the three types of bonds between V and\nbenzene (Bz) plays different roles. V 3d$_{z^2}$ orbital, extending along the\nmolecular axis, is weakly hybridized with Bz's HOMO-1 orbital to form the\n$\\sigma$-bond. It is quite localized and singly occupied, which contributes\n1$\\mu_B$ to the magnetic moment but little to the magnetic coupling of\nneighboring V magnetic moments. The in-plane d$_{x^2-y^2}$, d$_{xy}$ orbitals\nare hybridized with the LUMO of Bz and constitute the $\\delta$-bond. This\nhybridization is medium and crucial to the magnetic coupling though the\n$\\delta$ states have no net contribution to the total magnetic moment.\nd$_{xz}$, d$_{yz}$ and HOMO of Bz form a quite strong $\\pi$-bond to hold the\nmolecular structure but they are inactive in magnetism because their energy\nlevels are far away from the Fermi level. Based on the results of\nfirst-principles calculation, we point out that the ferromagnetism stability is\nclosely related with the mechanism proposed by Kanamori and Terakura [J.\nKanamori and K. Terakura, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 70, 1433 (2001)]. However, the\npresence of edge Bz's in the cluster introduces an important modification. A\nsimple model is constructed to explain the essence of the physical picture.\n	10.1143/JPSJ.77.014301	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	16 pages, 7 figures

In this note, we show that the model can be adjusted to the\npresent values of dark energy density parameter $\\Omega_q$ ($\\simeq 0.73$) and\nthe equation of state ${\\rm w}\\Z{q}$ ($\\simeq -1$) only if the numerical\ncoefficient $n$ takes a reasonably large value ($n\\gtrsim 3$) or the present\nvalue of the gravitational coupling of q-field to (dark) matter is also\nnonzero, namely, $\\tilde{Q}\\simeq \\frac{2}{n}(\\Omega\\Z{q0})^{3/2}>0$ where\n$\\Omega\\Z{q0}$ is the present value of dark energy density fraction. We also\ndiscuss some of the difficulties of this proposal as a viable dark energy model\nwith a constant $n$; especially, the bound imposed on the dark energy density\nparameter $\\Omega_q <0.1$ during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) requires $n<\n1/6$. To overcome this drawback, we outline a few modifications where such\nconstraints can be weakened or relaxed. Finally, by establishing a\ncorrespondence between the agegraphic dark energy scenario and the standard\nscalar-field model, we also point out some interesting features of an\nagegraphic quintessence model.\n	10.1016/j.physletb.2009.02.012	hep-th astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph	18 pages, several eps figures; significant changes in Secs. 2 & 3,\n  Journal version

Derived point spread functions (PSFs) from observations\nof asteroids are similar to the optical model. Significant excesses, however,\nare clearly seen around tails of the PSFs, whose contributions are about 30% of\nthe total power. All FIS functions are operating well in orbit, and its\nperformance meets the laboratory characterizations, except for the two longer\nwavelength bands, which are not performing as well as characterized.\nFurthermore, the FIS has a spectroscopic capability using a Fourier transform\nspectrometer (FTS). Because the FTS takes advantage of the optics and detectors\nof the photometer, it can simultaneously make a spectral map. This paper\nsummarizes the in-flight technical and operational performance of the FIS.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp2.S389	astro-ph	23 pages, 10 figures, and 2 tables.

538	0708.3056	Schwinger-Dyson operator of Yang-Mills matrix models with ghosts and\n  derivations of the graded shuffle algebra	2007-08-22	2008-04-05	J.Phys.A41:145402,2008	  We consider large-N multi-matrix models whose action closely mimics that of\nYang-Mills theory, including gauge-fixing and ghost terms. We show that the\nfactorized Schwinger-Dyson loop equations, expressed in terms of the generating\nseries of gluon and ghost correlations G(xi), are quadratic equations S^i G = G\nxi^i G in concatenation of correlations. The Schwinger-Dyson operator S^i is\nbuilt from the left annihilation operator, which does not satisfy the Leibnitz\nrule with respect to concatenation. So the loop equations are not differential\nequations. We show that left annihilation is a derivation of the graded shuffle\nproduct of gluon and ghost correlations. The shuffle product is the point-wise\nproduct of Wilson loops, expressed in terms of correlations. So in the limit\nwhere concatenation is approximated by shuffle products, the loop equations\nbecome differential equations. Remarkably, the Schwinger-Dyson operator as a\nwhole is also a derivation of the graded shuffle product. This allows us to\nturn the loop equations into linear equations for the shuffle reciprocal, which\nmight serve as a starting point for an approximation scheme.\n	10.1088/1751-8113/41/14/145402	hep-th	13 pages, added discussion & references, title changed, minor\n  corrections, published version

However, few irregular galaxies have observed magnetic field\nstructures.

539	0708.3140	Optical Identification of 15 Micron Sources in the AKARI Performance\n  Verification Field toward the North Ecliptic Pole	2007-08-23	\N	\N	  We present the results of optical identifications for 257 mid-infrared\nsources detected with a deep 15um survey over approximately 80 arcmin^2 area in\nthe AKARI performance verification field near the North Ecliptic Pole. The 15um\nfluxes of the sources range from 1 mJy down to 40 uJy, approximately a half of\nwhich are below 100 uJy. Optical counterparts were searched for within a 2-3\narcsec radius in both the BVRi'z' catalog generated by using the deep\nSubaru/Suprime-cam field which covers one-third of the performance verification\nfield, and the g'r'i'z' catalog based on observations made with MegaCam at\nCFHT. We found B-R and R-z' colours of sources with successful optical\nidentifications are systematically redder than that of the entire optical\nsample in the same field. Moreover, approximately 40% of the 15um sources show\ncolours R-L15>5, which cannot be explained by the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of normal quiescent spiral galaxies, but are consistent with SEDs of\nredshifted (z>1) starburst or ultraluminous infrared galaxies. This result\nindicates that the fraction of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies in our faint\n15um sample is much larger than that in our brighter 15um sources, which is\nconsistent with the evolving mid-infrared luminosity function derived by recent\nstudies based on the Spitzer 24um deep surveys. Based on an SED fitting\ntechnique, the nature of the faint 15um sources is further discussed for a\nselected number of sources with available K_s-band data.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp2.S543	astro-ph	\N

These theorems,\nhowever, do not apply in the case of non-linear electrodynamics. In the present\nwork numerical solutions describing charged black holes coupled to\nEuler-Heisenberg type non-linear electrodynamics in scalar-tensor theories of\ngravity with massless scalar field are found. In comparison to the\ncorresponding solution in General Relativity the presented solution has a\nsimpler causal structure the reason for which is the presence of the scalar\nfield.

546	0708.3392	Fluctuations in 21cm Emission After Reionization	2007-08-26	\N	\N	  The fluctuations in the emission of redshifted 21cm photons from neutral\ninter-galactic hydrogen will provide an unprecedented probe of the reionization\nera. Conventional wisdom assumes that this 21cm signal disappears as soon as\nreionization is complete, when little atomic hydrogen is left through most of\nthe volume of the inter-galactic medium (IGM). However observations of damped\nLy-alpha absorbers indicate that the fraction of hydrogen in its neutral form\nis significant by mass at all redshifts. Here we use a physically-motivated\nmodel to show that residual neutral gas, confined to dense regions in the IGM\nwith a high recombination rate, will generate a significant post-reionization\n21cm signal. We show that the power-spectrum of fluctuations in this signal\nwill be detectable by the first generation of low-frequency observatories at a\nsignal-to-noise that is comparable to that achievable in observations of the\nreionization era. The statistics of 21cm fluctuations will therefore probe not\nonly the pre-reionization IGM, but rather the entire process of HII region\noverlap, as well as the appearance of the diffuse ionized IGM.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12568.x	astro-ph	10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS

Phys. 105(12), 123923 (2009)	  Ni3C nanoparticles of about 40 nm have been studied experimentally to exhibit\nweak ferromagnetic (FM), spin-glass (SG) and paramagnetic (PM) properties. The\nfreezing temperature of the SG phase at zero applied field is determined as,\nTF0 ~ 11.0 K. At T > TF0, a very weak ferromagnetism has been observed over a\nPM background. The Curie temperature, TC, is shown to exceed 300 K and the\nferromagnetism at 300 K is determined as about 0.02 emu/g (~6.7*10^{-4}mu_B per\nNi3C formula unit) by subtracting the background paramagnetism. An anomalous\ndip appears in the temperature dependent coercivity, HC(T), near the freezing\ntemperature, TF0. It reflects a distortedly reduced coercivity in the M(H)\nhysteresis loop measured at T = TF0 with the applied sweeping field around H =\n0. This is attributable to the exchange coupling effect between the SG and the\nweak FM phases. The possible origin of the magnetic moments that account for\nthe observed FM, SG and PM properties is discussed.\n	10.1063/1.3155997	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	25 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, J Appl Phys In press

Usually it is not easy to be treated very well. Several\nones for material point method were proposed by Bardenhangen, Brackbill, and\n  Sulsky\\cite{Bardenhagen2000,Bardenhagen2001}, Hu and Chen\\cite{Hu_Chen2003}.\n  An improved one for three-dimensional material point method is presented in\nthis paper. The improved algorithm emphasizes the energy conservation of the\nsystem and faithfully recovers opposite acting forces between contacting\nbodies. Contrasted to the one by Bardenhagen, both the normal and tangential\ncontacting forces are more appropriately applied to the contacting bodies via\nthe contacting nodes of the background mesh; Contrasted to the one by Hu and\nChen, not only the tangential velocities but also the normal ones are handled\nseparately in respective individual mesh. This treatment ensures not only the\ncontact/sliding/separation procedure but also the friction between contacting\nbodies are recovered. The presented contact algorithm is validated via\nnumerical experiments including rolling simulation, impact of elastic spheres,\nimpact of a Taylor bar and impact of plastic spheres. The numerical results\nshow that the multi-mesh material point method with the improved contact\nalgorithm is more suitable for solving collision problems.\n	10.1088/0253-6102/49/5/09	physics.comp-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.class-ph	Figures 1,5,6,8,10,12 in JPG format, Accepted for publication in\n  Communications in Theoretical Physics

High-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity is ubiquitous in the\ncuprates containing CuO2 planes but each cuprate has its own character. The\nstudy of the material dependence of the d-wave superconducting gap (SG) should\nprovide important insights into the mechanism of high-Tc. However, because of\nthe 'pseudogap' phenomenon, it is often unclear whether the energy gaps\nobserved by spectroscopic techniques really represent the SG. Here, we report\nspectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) studies of\nnearly-optimally-doped Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 (Na-CCOC) with Tc = 25 ~ 28 K. They\nenable us to observe the quasi-particle interference (QPI) effect in this\nmaterial, through which unambiguous new information on the SG is obtained. The\nanalysis of QPI in Na-CCOC reveals that the SG dispersion near the gap node is\nalmost identical to that of Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (Bi2212) at the same doping level,\nwhile Tc of Bi2212 is 3 times higher than that of Na-CCOC. We also find that SG\nin Na-CCOC is confined in narrower energy and momentum ranges than Bi2212.

The radiative corrections include\nlarge logarithms which have to be resummed to all orders in the strong coupling\nconstant in order to get reliable perturbative results. In this work, we\nperform a first and extensive study of the resummation effects for\nsupersymmetric particle pair production at hadron colliders. We focus on\nDrell-Yan like slepton-pair and slepton-sneutrino associated production in\nminimal supergravity and gauge-mediated supersymmetry-breaking scenarios, and\npresent accurate transverse-momentum and invariant-mass distributions, as well\nas total cross sections.\n  In non-minimal supersymmetric models, novel effects of flavour violation may\noccur. In this case, the flavour structure in the squark sector cannot be\ndirectly deduced from the trilinear Yukawa couplings of the fermion and Higgs\nsupermultiplets. We perform a precise numerical analysis of the experimentally\nallowed parameter space in the case of minimal supergravity scenarios with\nnon-minimal flavour violation, looking for regions allowed by low-energy,\nelectroweak precision, and cosmological data. Leading order cross sections for\nthe production of squarks and gauginos at hadron colliders are implemented in a\nflexible computer program, allowing us to study in detail the dependence of\nthese cross sections on flavour violation.\n	\N	hep-ph	Ph.D. Thesis, 155 pages, 217 figures; typos corrected

Subsequent experiments with classical\npulses have also revealed apparent superluminal group velocities as well as\ntunneling times that saturate with barrier length, a phenomenon known as the\nHartman effect.

561	0708.3890	Rapid planetesimal formation in turbulent circumstellar discs	2007-08-29	\N	\N	  The initial stages of planet formation in circumstellar gas discs proceed via\ndust grains that collide and build up larger and larger bodies (Safronov 1969).\nHow this process continues from metre-sized boulders to kilometre-scale\nplanetesimals is a major unsolved problem (Dominik et al. 2007): boulders stick\ntogether poorly (Benz 2000), and spiral into the protostar in a few hundred\norbits due to a head wind from the slower rotating gas (Weidenschilling 1977).\nGravitational collapse of the solid component has been suggested to overcome\nthis barrier (Safronov 1969, Goldreich & Ward 1973, Youdin & Shu 2002). Even\nlow levels of turbulence, however, inhibit sedimentation of solids to a\nsufficiently dense midplane layer (Weidenschilling & Cuzzi 1993, Dominik et al.\n2007), but turbulence must be present to explain observed gas accretion in\nprotostellar discs (Hartmann 1998). Here we report the discovery of efficient\ngravitational collapse of boulders in locally overdense regions in the\nmidplane. The boulders concentrate initially in transient high pressures in the\nturbulent gas (Johansen, Klahr, & Henning 2006), and these concentrations are\naugmented a further order of magnitude by a streaming instability (Youdin &\nGoodman 2005, Johansen, Henning, & Klahr 2006, Johansen & Youdin 2007) driven\nby the relative flow of gas and solids. We find that gravitationally bound\nclusters form with masses comparable to dwarf planets and containing a\ndistribution of boulder sizes. Gravitational collapse happens much faster than\nradial drift, offering a possible path to planetesimal formation in accreting\ncircumstellar discs.\n	10.1038/nature06086	astro-ph	To appear in Nature (30 August 2007 issue). 18 pages (in referee\n  mode), 3 figures.

Various methods have been developed\nto produce ultracold molecules in pre-set quantum states. For future\nexperiments it will be important to efficiently transfer these molecules from\ntheir initial quantum state to other quantum states of interest. Optical Raman\nschemes are excellent tools for transfer, but can be involved in terms of\nequipment, laser stabilization and finding the right transitions. Here we\ndemonstrate a very general and simple way for transfer of molecules from one\nquantum state to a neighboring quantum state with better than 99% efficiency.\nThe scheme is based on Zeeman tuning the molecular state to avoided level\ncrossings where radio-frequency transitions can then be carried out.

563	0708.3988	Semiclassical Evolution of Dissipative Markovian Systems	2007-08-29	2008-12-20	J. Phys. A, 42 (2009) 065306 (29pp)	  A semiclassical approximation for an evolving density operator, driven by a\n"closed" hamiltonian operator and "open" markovian Lindblad operators, is\nobtained. The theory is based on the chord function, i.e. the Fourier transform\nof the Wigner function. It reduces to an exact solution of the Lindblad master\nequation if the hamiltonian operator is a quadratic function and the Lindblad\noperators are linear functions of positions and momenta.\n  Initially, the semiclassical formulae for the case of hermitian Lindblad\noperators are reinterpreted in terms of a (real) double phase space, generated\nby an appropriate classical double Hamiltonian. An extra "open" term is added\nto the double Hamiltonian by the non-hermitian part of the Lindblad operators\nin the general case of dissipative markovian evolution. The particular case of\ngeneric hamiltonian operators, but linear dissipative Lindblad operators, is\nstudied in more detail. A Liouville-type equivariance still holds for the\ncorresponding classical evolution in double phase, but the centre subspace,\nwhich supports the Wigner function, is compressed, along with expansion of its\nconjugate subspace, which supports the chord function.\n  Decoherence narrows the relevant region of double phase space to the\nneighborhood of a caustic for both the Wigner function and the chord function.\nThis difficulty is avoided by a propagator in a mixed representation, so that a\nfurther "small-chord" approximation leads to a simple generalization of the\nquadratic theory for evolving Wigner functions.\n	10.1088/1751-8113/42/6/065306	quant-ph math-ph math.MP	33 pages - accepted to J.

In addition to deep imaging from 1.8-26.5um for the pointed\nobservation mode of the AKARI, it has a spectroscopic capability in its\nspectral range. By replacing the imaging filters by transmission-type\ndispersers on the filter wheels, it provides low-resolution (lambda/d_lambda ~\n20-120) spectroscopy with slits or in a wide imaging field-of-view\n(approximately 10'X10'). The IRC spectroscopic mode is unique in space infrared\nmissions in that it has the capability to perform sensitive wide-field\nspectroscopic surveys in the near- and mid-infrared wavelength ranges.

We show an\nexample of the application of that capability to an active region sit-and-stare\nobservation in which the EIS slit is placed at one location on the Sun and many\nexposures are taken while the spacecraft tracking keeps the same solar location\nwithin the slit. For the active region examined (NOAA 10930), we find that\nsignificant intensity and Doppler-shift fluctuations as a function of time are\npresent at a number of locations. These fluctuations appear to be similar to\nthose observed in high-temperature emission lines with other space-borne\nspectroscopic instruments. With its increased sensitivity over earlier\nspectrometers and its ability to image many emission lines simultaneously, EIS\nshould provide significant new constraints on Doppler-shift oscillations in the\ncorona.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S713	astro-ph	7 Pages, 7 figures

571	0708.4372	Non-Equilibrium Quantum Dissipation	2007-08-31	\N	PRB 76 195316 (2007)	  Dissipative processes in non-equilibrium many-body systems are fundamentally\ndifferent than their equilibrium counterparts. Such processes are of great\nimportance for the understanding of relaxation in single molecule devices. As a\ndetailed case study, we investigate here a generic spin-fermion model, where a\ntwo-level system couples to two metallic leads with different chemical\npotentials. We present results for the spin relaxation rate in the nonadiabatic\nlimit for an arbitrary coupling to the leads, using both analytical and exact\nnumerical methods. The non-equilibrium dynamics is reflected by an exponential\nrelaxation at long times and via complex phase shifts, leading in some cases to\nan "anti-orthogonality" effect. In the limit of strong system-lead coupling at\nzero temperature we demonstrate the onset of a Marcus-like Gaussian decay with\n{\\it voltage difference} activation. This is analogous to the equilibrium\nspin-boson model, where at strong coupling and high temperatures the spin\nexcitation rate manifests temperature activated Gaussian behavior. We find that\nthere is no simple linear relationship between the role of the temperature in\nthe bosonic system and a voltage drop in a non-equilibrium electronic case. The\ntwo models also differ by the orthogonality-catastrophe factor existing in a\nfermionic system, which modifies the resulting lineshapes. Implications for\ncurrent characteristics are discussed. We demonstrate the violation of\npair-wise Coulomb gas behavior for strong coupling to the leads. The results\npresented in this paper form the basis of an exact, non-perturbative\ndescription of steady-state quantum dissipative systems.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.76.195316	cond-mat.mes-hall	\N

573	0709.0005	A resonant-term-based model including a nascent disk, precession, and\n  oblateness: application to GJ 876	2007-08-31	\N	\N	  Investigations of two resonant planets orbiting a star or two resonant\nsatellites orbiting a planet often rely on a few resonant and secular terms in\norder to obtain a representative quantitative description of the system's\ndynamical evolution. We present a semianalytic model which traces the orbital\nevolution of any two resonant bodies in a first- through fourth-order\neccentricity or inclination-based resonance dominated by the resonant and\nsecular arguments of the user's choosing. By considering the variation of\nlibration width with different orbital parameters, we identify regions of phase\nspace which give rise to different resonant ''depths,'' and propose methods to\nmodel libration profiles. We apply the model to the GJ 876 extrasolar planetary\nsystem, quantify the relative importance of the relevant resonant and secular\ncontributions, and thereby assess the goodness of the common approximation of\nrepresenting the system by just the presumably dominant terms. We highlight the\ndanger in using ''order'' as the metric for accuracy in the orbital solution by\nrevealing the unnatural libration centers produced by the second-order, but not\nfirst-order, solution, and by demonstrating that the true orbital solution lies\nsomewhere ''in-between'' the third- and fourth-order solutions. We also present\nformulas used to incorporate perturbations from central-body oblateness and\nprecession, and a protoplanetary or protosatellite thin disk with gaps, into a\nresonant system. We quantify these contributions to the GJ 876 system, and\nthereby highlight the conditions which must exist for multi-planet exosystems\nto be significantly influenced by such factors. We find that massive enough\ndisks may convert resonant libration into circulation; such disk-induced\nsignatures may provide constraints for future studies of exoplanet systems.\n	10.1007/s10569-007-9097-2	astro-ph	39 pages of body text, 21 figures, 5 tables, 1 appendix, accepted for\n  publication in Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy

575	0709.0133	Temperature-dependent Raman scattering of natural and isotopically\n  substituted PbS	2007-09-02	\N	\N	  Lead sulfide is an important semiconductor that has found technological\napplications for over a century. Raman spectroscopy, a standard tool for the\ninvestigation and characterization of semiconductors, has limited application\nto this material because of the forbidden nature of its first order scattering\nand its opacity to visible lasers. Nevertheless, useful vibrational spectra\nfrom two-phonon processes are obtained with red lasers, probably because of a\nresonance in the concomitant electronic transitions. Here we report temperature\ndependent spectra, covering the 10-300 K range, for two samples with different\nsulfur isotopic compositions. The results are analyzed by comparison with ab\ninitio calculations of the lattice dynamics of PbS and the corresponding\ndensities of one and two-phonon states.

Soc. 53, 2835 (2008) (5 pages)	  The properties of polycrystalline wurtzite Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O (0 <= x <= 0.15)\nhave been studied, by powder X-ray diffraction, including an analysis of the\nX-ray line-broadening, and by luminescence, absorption, and Raman\nspectroscopies. We have previously established from synchrotron X-ray\ndifffraction that with increasing Mg-concentration, the c-axis compresses, and\nthe off-center cation displacement within each tetrahedral (Zn,Mg)O_{4} unit\ndecreases. Here we perform a size-strain line-broadening analysis of the XRD\npeaks, which reveals that the Mg-substitution reduces the coherent crystallite\nsize and also develops the lattice microstrain. The optical properties of the\nsamples have been characterized by diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy and\nfluorimetry. Both the optical band gap and the band-edge emission energies\ngradually increase with the Mg-concentration in Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O. The\nMg-substituted samples show broader band tails near the absorption edge, due to\nthe increase of crystal imperfections. The peak broadening of the E_{2}{high}\nRaman mode, upon the Mg-substitution, is also ascribed to the phonon shortening\nlifetime mechanism via crystal defects.\n	10.3938/jkps.53.2835	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	5 pages, 5 figures, 1 Table

We present our JHK band data along\nwith optical images, which when considered together reveal a complex\ncircumstellar structure. We examined the colors of associated nebula and\ncompared the geometry of the outflow/disk system suggested by our data with\nthat already proposed on the basis of previous studies. Our K-band image shows\nbright circumstellar nebulosity detected within 2"(300AU) around the central\nsource while it is less conspicuous at shorter wavelengths such as J and\noptical. P.A. and size of this red color nebulosity in our H-K color image\nagree with those of the previously detected polarization disk. These data\nagreement indicate that this bright circumstellar nebulosity region which\nfollows the reddening law might be attributed to a disk-like structure. At J\nand optical wavelengths, several blue knot-like structures are detected around\nand beyond the bright circumstellar nebulosity. We suggest that these knotty\nreflection nebulae may represent disintegrating fragments of an infalling\nenvelope. The three-color composite image has an appearance of arc-shaped\nnebulosity extending to the north and to the east through the central source.\nOn the other end of this arc-shaped structure, the nebula appears to become\nmore extended (2."3 long) to the southwest.

582	0709.0599	On Universal Properties of Capacity-Approaching LDPC Ensembles	2007-09-05	2015-02-26	\N	  This paper is focused on the derivation of some universal properties of\ncapacity-approaching low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles whose\ntransmission takes place over memoryless binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS)\nchannels. Properties of the degree distributions, graphical complexity and the\nnumber of fundamental cycles in the bipartite graphs are considered via the\nderivation of information-theoretic bounds. These bounds are expressed in terms\nof the target block/ bit error probability and the gap (in rate) to capacity.\nMost of the bounds are general for any decoding algorithm, and some others are\nproved under belief propagation (BP) decoding. Proving these bounds under a\ncertain decoding algorithm, validates them automatically also under any\nsub-optimal decoding algorithm. A proper modification of these bounds makes\nthem universal for the set of all MBIOS channels which exhibit a given\ncapacity. Bounds on the degree distributions and graphical complexity apply to\nfinite-length LDPC codes and to the asymptotic case of an infinite block\nlength. The bounds are compared with capacity-approaching LDPC code ensembles\nunder BP decoding, and they are shown to be informative and are easy to\ncalculate. Finally, some interesting open problems are considered.\n	\N	cs.IT math.IT	Published in the IEEE Trans. on Information Theory, vol. 55, no. 7,\n  pp. 2956 - 2990, July 2009

584	0709.0651	GRB970228 and a class of GRBs with an initial spikelike emission	2007-09-05	\N	Astron.Astrophys. 474 (2007) L13-L16	  (Shortened) The Swift and HETE-2 discovery of an afterglow associated\npossibly with short GRBs opened the new problematic of their nature and\nclassification. This has been further enhanced by the GRB060614 observation and\nby a re-analysis of the BATSE catalog leading to the identification of a new\nGRB class with "an occasional softer extended emission lasting tenths of\nseconds after an initial spikelike emission". We plan: a) to fit this new class\nof "hybrid" sources within our "canonical GRB" scenario, where all GRBs are\ngenerated by a "common engine" (i.e. the gravitational collapse to a black\nhole); b) to propose GRB970228 as the prototype of the such a class. We analyze\nBeppoSAX data on GRB970228 in the 40-700 keV and 2-26 keV energy bands within\nthe "fireshell" model. We find that GRB970228 is a "canonical GRB", like e.g.\nGRB050315, with the main peculiarity of a particularly low CircumBurst Medium\n(CBM) average density n_{cbm}~10^{-3} #/cm^3. We also simulate the light curve\ncorresponding to a rescaled CBM density profile with n_{cbm}=1 #/cm^3. From\nsuch a comparison it follows that the total time-integrated luminosity is a\nfaithful indicator of the GRB nature, contrary to the peak luminosity which is\nmerely a function of the CBM density. We call attention on discriminating the\nshort GRBs between the "genuine" and the "fake" ones. The "genuine" ones are\nintrinsically short, with baryon loading B \\la 10^{-5}, as stated in our\noriginal classification. The "fake" ones, characterized by an initial spikelike\nemission followed by an extended emission lasting tenths of seconds, have a\nbaryon loading 10^{-4} \\la B \\leq 10^{-2}. They are observed as such only due\nto an underdense CBM consistent with a galactic halo environment which deflates\nthe afterglow intensity.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20078300	astro-ph	4 pages, 4 figures, to appear on A&A Letters

We have successfully\ndetected a trigonometric parallax of 189+/-8 micro-arcsec, corresponding to the\nsource distance of 5.28 +0.24/-0.22 kpc. This is the smallest parallax ever\nmeasured, and the first one detected beyond 5 kpc. The source distance as well\nas proper motions are used to constrain the outer rotation curve of the Galaxy,\ndemonstrating that the difference of rotation velocities at the Sun and at S269\n(which is 13.1 kpc away from the Galaxy's center) is less than 3%. This gives\nthe strongest constraint on the flatness of the outer rotation curve and\nprovides a direct confirmation on the existence of large amount of dark matter\nin the Galaxy's outer disk.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.5.889	astro-ph	7 pages and 4 figures, Accepted by PASJ (Vol. 59, No. 5, October 25,\n  2007 issue)

Comp. 84 (2015), 1537-1569	  We use the elliptic reconstruction technique in combination with a duality\napproach to prove aposteriori error estimates for fully discrete back- ward\nEuler scheme for linear parabolic equations. As an application, we com- bine\nour result with the residual based estimators from the aposteriori esti- mation\nfor elliptic problems to derive space-error indicators and thus a fully\npractical version of the estimators bounding the error in the L \\infty (0, T ;\nL2({\\Omega})) norm. These estimators, which are of optimal order, extend those\nintroduced by Eriksson and Johnson (1991) by taking into account the error\ninduced by the mesh changes and allowing for a more flexible use of the\nelliptic estima- tors. For comparison with previous results we derive also an\nenergy-based aposteriori estimate for the L \\infty (0, T ; L2({\\Omega}))-error\nwhich simplifies a previous one given in Lakkis and Makridakis (2006). We then\ncompare both estimators (duality vs. energy) in practical situations and draw\nconclusions.\n	10.1090/S0025-5718-2014-02912-8	math.NA math.AP	30 pages, including 7 color plates in 4 figures

593	0709.0985	Matterwave Transport Without Transit	2007-09-06	\N	Phys. Rev. A 77, 061602(R) (2008)	  Classically it is impossible to have transport without transit, i.e., if the\npoints one, two and three lie sequentially along a path then an object moving\nfrom one to three must, at some point in time, be located at two. However, for\na quantum particle in a three-well system it is possible to transport the\nparticle between wells one and three such that the probability of finding it at\nany time in the classically accessible state in well two is negligible. We\nconsider theoretically the analogous scenario for a Bose-Einstein condensate\nconfined within a three well system. In particular, we predict the adiabatic\ntransportation of an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate of 2000 Li atoms from\nwell one to well three without transiting the allowed intermediate region. To\nan observer of this macroscopic quantum effect it would appear that, over a\ntimescale of the order of one second, the condensate had transported, but not\ntransited, a macroscopic distance of 20 microns between wells one and three.\n	10.1103/PhysRevA.77.061602	cond-mat.other physics.atom-ph quant-ph	6 pages, 4 figures

595	0709.1060	Spitzer-MIPS survey of the young stellar content in the Vela Molecular\n  Cloud-D	2007-09-07	\N	\N	  A new, unbiased Spitzer-MIPS imaging survey (~1.8 square degs) of the young\nstellar content of the Vela Molecular Cloud-D is presented. The survey is\ncomplete down to 5mJy and 250mJy at 24micron (mu) and 70mu, respectively. 849\nsources are detected at 24mu and 52 of them also have a 70mu counterpart. The\nVMR-D region is one that we have already partially mapped in dust and gas\nmillimeter emission, and we discuss the correlation between the Spitzer compact\nsources and the mm contours. About half of the 24mu sources are located inside\nthe region delimited by the 12CO(1-0) contours (corresponding to only one third\nof the full area mapped with MIPS) with a consequent density increase of about\n100% of the 24mu sources [four times for 70mu ones] moving from outside to\ninside the CO contours. About 400 sources have a 2MASS counterpart. So we have\nconstructed a Ks vs. Ks-[24] diagram and identified the protostellar\npopulation. We find an excess of Class I sources in VMR-D in comparison with\nother star forming regions. This result is reasonably biased by the sensitivity\nlimits, or, alternatively, may reflect a very short lifetime (<=10^6yr) of the\nprotostellar content in this cloud. The MIPS images have identified embedded\ncool objects in most of the previously identified starless cores; in addition,\nthere are 6 very young, possibly Class 0 objects identified. Finally we report\nfinding of the driving sources for a set of five out of six very compact\nprotostellar jets previously discovered in near-infrared images.\n	10.1086/522670	astro-ph	29 pages, 14 figures.

Matter 19, 432201 (2007)	  Pyroxenes with the general formula $AM$Si$_2$O$_6$ ($A$ = mono- or divalent\nmetal, $M$ = di- or trivalent metal) are shown to be a new class of\nmultiferroic materials. In particular, we have found so far that\nNaFeSi$_2$O$_6$ becomes ferroelectric in a magnetically ordered state below\n$\\simeq 6$ K. Similarly, magnetically driven ferroelectricity is also detected\nin the Li homologues, LiFeSi$_2$O$_6$ ($T_C \\simeq 18$ K) and LiCrSi$_2$O$_6$\n($T_C \\simeq 11$ K). In all these monoclinic systems the electric polarization\ncan be strongly modified by magnetic fields. Measurements of magnetic\nsusceptibility, pyroelectric current and dielectric constants (and their\ndependence on magnetic field) are performed using a natural crystal of aegirine\n(NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$) and synthetic crystals of LiFeSi$_2$O$_6$ and LiCrSi$_2$O$_6$\ngrown from melt solution. For NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$ a temperature versus magnetic\nfield phase diagram for NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$ is proposed. Exchange constants are\ncomputed on the basis of {\\it ab initio} band structure calculations. The\npossibility of a spiral magnetic structure caused by frustration as origin of\nthe multiferroic behaviour is discussed. We propose that other pyroxenes may\nalso be multiferroic, and that the versatility of this family offers an\nexceptional opportunity to study general conditions for and mechanisms of\nmagnetically driven ferroelectricity.\n	10.1088/0953-8984/19/43/432201	cond-mat.str-el	10 pages, 4 figures; calculated excange constants have been updated
597	0709.1151	Euler-Bernoulli beams from a symmetry standpoint-characterization of\n  equivalent equations	2007-09-07	\N	\N	  We completely solve the equivalence problem for Euler-Bernoulli equation\nusing Lie symmetry analysis. We show that the quotient of the symmetry Lie\nalgebra of the Bernoulli equation by the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra\nspanned by solution symmetries is a representation of one of the following Lie\nalgebras: $2A_1$, $A_1\\oplus A_2$, $3A_1$, or $A_{3,3}\\oplus A_1$. Each\nquotient symmetry Lie algebra determines an equivalence class of\nEuler-Bernoulli equations. Save for the generic case corresponding to arbitrary\nlineal mass density and flexural rigidity, we characterize the elements of each\nclass by giving a determined set of differential equations satisfied by\nphysical parameters (lineal mass density and flexural rigidity). For each\nclass, we provide a simple representative and we explicitly construct\ntransformations that maps a class member to its representative. The maximally\nsymmetric class described by the four-dimensional quotient symmetry Lie algebra\n$A_{3,3}\\oplus A_1$ corresponds to Euler-Bernoulli equations homeomorphic to\nthe uniform one (constant lineal mass density and flexural rigidity) . We\nrigorously derive some non-trivial and non-uniform Euler-Bernoulli equations\nreducible to the uniform unit beam.

We operate in deep inference, which is more general than other syntactic\nparadigms, and where normalisation is more difficult to control. We argue that\natomic flows are a significant technical advance for normalisation theory,\nbecause 1) the technique they support is largely independent of syntax; 2)\nindeed, it is largely independent of logical inference rules; 3) they\nconstitute a powerful geometric formalism, which is more intuitive than syntax.\n	10.2168/LMCS-4(1:9)2008	math.LO cs.LO	\N

614	0709.1853	Formation of Moving Magnetic Features and Penumbral Magnetic Fields with\n  Hinode/SOT	2007-09-12	\N	\N	  Vector magnetic fields of moving magnetic features (MMFs) are well observed\nwith the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard the Hinode satellite. We focus on\nthe evolution of three MMFs with the SOT in this study. We found that an MMF\nhaving relatively vertical fields with polarity same as the sunspot is detached\nfrom the penumbra around the granules appeared in the outer penumbra. This\nsuggests that granular motions in the outer penumbra are responsible for the\ndisintegration of the sunspot. Two MMFs with polarity opposite to the sunspot\nare located around the outer edge of horizontal fields extending from the\npenumbra. This is an evidence that the MMFs with polarity opposite to the\nsunspot are prolongation of penumbral horizontal fields. Radshifts larger than\nsonic velocity in the photosphere are detected for some of the MMFs with\npolarity opposite to the sunspot.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S607	astro-ph	7 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ (Hinode Special\n  Issue)
615	0709.1948	Information theoretic approach to interactive learning	2007-09-12	2009-02-08	EPL 85 (2009) 28005	  The principles of statistical mechanics and information theory play an\nimportant role in learning and have inspired both theory and the design of\nnumerous machine learning algorithms. The new aspect in this paper is a focus\non integrating feedback from the learner. A quantitative approach to\ninteractive learning and adaptive behavior is proposed, integrating model- and\ndecision-making into one theoretical framework. This paper follows simple\nprinciples by requiring that the observer's world model and action policy\nshould result in maximal predictive power at minimal complexity. Classes of\noptimal action policies and of optimal models are derived from an objective\nfunction that reflects this trade-off between prediction and complexity. The\nresulting optimal models then summarize, at different levels of abstraction,\nthe process's causal organization in the presence of the learner's actions. A\nfundamental consequence of the proposed principle is that the learner's optimal\naction policies balance exploration and control as an emerging property.\nInterestingly, the explorative component is present in the absence of policy\nrandomness, i.e. in the optimal deterministic behavior. This is a direct result\nof requiring maximal predictive power in the presence of feedback.\n	10.1209/0295-5075/85/28005	physics.data-an physics.bio-ph	6 pages

The mosaic covers 10.8 x 12.3 square\ndegrees with an angular resolution of 40", corresponding to a spatial scale of\n10pc in the LMC. The final image is suitable for studying emission on all\nscales between 40" and the surveyed area.

Two non-standard reduction techniques that we used to process\nthe ATCA visibility data may be of interest for future wide-field radio\ncontinuum surveys.

623	0709.2200	Statistical Investigation of Connected Structures of Stock Networks in\n  Financial Time Series	2007-09-13	\N	\N	  In this study, we have investigated factors of determination which can affect\nthe connected structure of a stock network. The representative index for\ntopological properties of a stock network is the number of links with other\nstocks. We used the multi-factor model, extensively acknowledged in financial\nliterature. In the multi-factor model, common factors act as independent\nvariables while returns of individual stocks act as dependent variables. We\ncalculated the coefficient of determination, which represents the measurement\nvalue of the degree in which dependent variables are explained by independent\nvariables. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the number of\nlinks in the stock network and the coefficient of determination in the\nmulti-factor model. We used individual stocks traded on the market indices of\nKorea, Japan, Canada, Italy and the UK. The results are as follows. We found\nthat the mean coefficient of determination of stocks with a large number of\nlinks have higher values than those with a small number of links with other\nstocks. These results suggest that common factors are significantly\ndeterministic factors to be taken into account when making a stock network.\nFurthermore, stocks with a large number of links to other stocks can be more\naffected by common factors.\n	10.3938/jkps.53.3837	q-fin.ST physics.data-an	11 pages, 2 figures
624	0709.2230	Hard X-ray Variability of AGN	2007-09-14	\N	\N	  Aims: Active Galactic Nuclei are known to be variable throughout the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. An energy domain poorly studied in this respect is\nthe hard X-ray range above 20 keV.\n  Methods: The first 9 months of the Swift/BAT all-sky survey are used to study\nthe 14 - 195 keV variability of the 44 brightest AGN. The sources have been\nselected due to their detection significance of >10 sigma. We tested the\nvariability using a maximum likelihood estimator and by analysing the structure\nfunction.\n  Results: Probing different time scales, it appears that the absorbed AGN are\nmore variable than the unabsorbed ones. The same applies for the comparison of\nSeyfert 2 and Seyfert 1 objects. As expected the blazars show stronger\nvariability. 15% of the non-blazar AGN show variability of >20% compared to the\naverage flux on time scales of 20 days, and 30% show at least 10% flux\nvariation. All the non-blazar AGN which show strong variability are\nlow-luminosity objects with L(14-195 keV) < 1E44 erg/sec.\n  Conclusions: Concerning the variability pattern, there is a tendency of\nunabsorbed or type 1 galaxies being less variable than the absorbed or type 2\nobjects at hardest X-rays. A more solid anti-correlation is found between\nvariability and luminosity, which has been previously observed in soft X-rays,\nin the UV, and in the optical domain.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20078355	astro-ph	9 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A

The\nabove 4D theory, where there is an explicit coupling between the non-Abelian\n1-form gauge field and the Dirac fields, is considered on a (4, 2)-dimensional\nsupermanifold, parameterized by the bosonic 4D space-time variables and a pair\nof Grassmannian variables. We show that the Grassmannian independence of the\nsuper Lagrangian density, expressed in terms of the (4, 2)-dimensional\nsuperfields, is a clear signature of the presence of the (anti-)BRST invariance\nin the original 4D theory.\n	10.1007/s12043-009-0045-4	hep-th	LaTeX file, 12 pages, journal version

627	0709.2397	Hinode Observations of Vector Magnetic Field Change Associated with a\n  Flare on 2006 December 13	2007-09-17	\N	\N	  Continuous observations of a flare productive active region 10930 were\nsuccessfully carried out with the Solar Optical Telescope onboard the Hinode\nspacecraft during 2007 December 6 to 19. We focus on the evolution of\nphotospheric magnetic fields in this active region, and magnetic field\nproperties at the site of the X3.4 class flare, using a time series of vector\nfield maps with high spatial resolution. The X3.4 class flare occurred on 2006\nDecember 13 at the apparent collision site between the large, opposite polarity\numbrae. Elongated magnetic structures with alternatingly positive and negative\npolarities resulting from flux emergence appeared one day before the flare in\nthe collision site penumbra. Subsequently, the polarity inversion line at the\ncollision site became very complicated. The number of bright loops in Ca II H\nincreased during the formation of these elongated magnetic structures. The\nflare ribbons and bright loops evolved along the polarity inversion line and\none footpoint of the bright loop was located in a region having a large\ndeparture of field azimuth angle with respect to its surroundings. The SOT\nobservations with high spatial resolution and high polarization precision\nreveal temporal change in fine structure of magnetic fields at the flare site:\nsome parts of the complicated polarity inversion line then disappeared, and in\nthose regions the azimuth angle of photospheric magnetic field changed by about\n90 degrees, becoming more spatially uniform within the collision site.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S779	astro-ph	6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ (Hinode Special\n  Issue)
628	0709.2467	Resonant Excitation of Disk Oscillations in Deformed Disks II: A Model\n  of High Frequency QPOs	2007-09-16	\N	\N	  The amplification of disk oscillations resulting from nonlinear resonant\ncouplings between the oscillations and a disk deformation is examined. The disk\nis geometrically thin and general relativistic with a non-rotating central\nsource. A Lagrangian formulation is adopted. The author examined the same\nproblem a few years ago, but here we derive a general stability criterion in a\nmore perspective way. Another distinct point from the previous work is that in\naddition to the case where the deformation is a warp, the case where the\ndeformation is a one-armed pattern symmetric with respect to the equatorial\nplane is considered. The results obtained show that in addition to the previous\nresults that the inertial-acoustic mode and g-mode oscillations are amplified\nby horizontal resonance in warped disks, they also amplified by horizontal\nresonance in disks deformed by one-armed pattern symmetric with respect to the\nequatorial plane. If we consider local oscillations that are localized around\nboundaries of their propagation region, the resonance occurs at $4r_{\\rm g}$,\nwhere $r_{\\rm g}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. If nonlocal oscillations are\nconsidered, frequency ranges of oscillations where oscillations are resonantly\namplified are specified.\n	10.1093/pasj/60.1.111	astro-ph	24 pages with 3 figures, to be published in PASJ Vol.60, No.1 (2008)
629	0709.2527	Formation Process of a Light Bridge Revealed with the Hinode Solar\n  Optical Telescope	2007-09-17	\N	\N	  The Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard HINODE successfully and continuously\nobserved a formation process of a light bridge in a matured sunspot of the NOAA\nactive region 10923 for several days with high spatial resolution. During its\nformation, many umbral dots were observed emerging from the leading edges of\npenumbral filaments, and intruding into the umbra rapidly. The precursor of the\nlight bridge formation was also identified as the relatively slow inward motion\nof the umbral dots which emerged not near the penumbra, but inside the umbra.\nThe spectro-polarimeter on SOT provided physical conditions in the photosphere\naround the umbral dots and the light bridges. We found the light bridges and\nthe umbral dots had significantly weaker magnetic fields associated with\nupflows relative to the core of the umbra, which implies that there was hot gas\nwith weak field strength penetrating from subphotosphere to near the visible\nsurface inside those structures. There needs to be a mechanism to drive the\ninward motion of the hot gas along the light bridges. We suggest that the\nemergence and the inward motion are triggered by a buoyant penumbral flux tube\nas well as the subphotospheric flow crossing the sunspot.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S577	astro-ph	8 pages, 6 figures, accepted in the PASJ Hinode special issue

The recently developed SMR, similarly to polarized neutron\nreflectometry (PNR), is an analytical tool for the determination of isotopic\nand magnetic structure of thin films and multilayers. It combines the\nsensitivity of M\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy to hyperfine interactions and the\ndepth selectivity of x-ray reflectometry. Specular reflection provides\ninformation on the depth profile, while off-specular scattering on the lateral\nstructure of scattering layers. Off-specular SMR and PNR intensity formulae of\na rather general multilayer with different domains, based on a Distorted\nIncident-Wave Approximation (DIWA) are presented. The Distorted-Wave Born\nApproximation (DWBA) results are given in an Appendix. Physical and numerical\nimplications, why using DIWA, are explained. The temporal character of SMR\nimposes specific differences between SMR and PNR. In order to reveal the limits\nof DIWA and to compare the two analytical methods, two-dimensional diffuse SMR\nand PNR maps of an antiferromagnetic multilayer are calculated and critically\ncompared.

633	0709.2780	The stellar content of low redshift BL Lac host galaxies from\n  multicolour imaging	2007-09-18	\N	\N	  We present B-band imaging of 18 low redshift (z<0.3) BL Lac objects for which\ntheir host galaxies were previously resolved in the R-band and the\nnear-infrared H-band. For a subset of the objects, also U- and V-band imaging\nis presented. These data are used to investigate the blue-red-near-infrared\ncolours and the colour gradients of the host galaxies of BL Lacs in comparison\nwith other elliptical galaxies with and without nuclear activity. In all cases\ngalaxies are well represented by an elliptical model, with average absolute\nmagnitude M_B=-21.6+-0.7 and average scale length R_e=7.6+-3.2 kpc. The\nbest-fit B-band Kormendy relation is in reasonable agreement with that obtained\nfor normal ellipticals and radio galaxies. This structural and dynamical\nsimilarity indicates that all massive elliptical galaxies can experience\nnuclear activity without significant perturbation of their global structure.\nThe distributions of the integrated blue/near-infrared colour (with average\nB-H=3.5+-0.5) and colour gradient (with average Delta(B-R)/Delta(log\nr)=-0.14+-0.75) of the BL Lac hosts are much wider than those for normal\nellipticals, and most BL Lac objects have bluer hosts and/or steeper colour\ngradients than those in normal ellipticals. The blue colours are likely caused\nby a young stellar population component, and indicates a link between star\nformation caused by an interaction/merging event and the onset of the nuclear\nactivity. This result is corroborated by stellar population modelling,\nindicating a presence of young/intermediate age populations in the majority of\nthe sample, in agreement with low redshift quasar hosts. The lack of strong\nsigns of interaction may require a significant time delay between the event\nwith associated star formation episodes and the start of the nuclear activity.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20078202	astro-ph	16 pages, 10 figures
637	0709.2955	Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations in 21cm Emission: A Probe of Dark Energy\n  out to High Redshifts	2007-09-19	\N	\N	  Low-frequency observatories are currently being constructed with the goal of\ndetecting redshifted 21cm emission from the epoch of reionization. These\nobservatories will also be able to detect intensity fluctuations in the\ncumulative 21cm emission after reionization, from hydrogen in unresolved damped\nLy-alpha absorbers (such as gas rich galaxies) down to a redshift z~3.5. The\ninferred power spectrum of 21cm fluctuations at all redshifts will show\nacoustic oscillations, whose co-moving scale can be used as a standard ruler to\ninfer the evolution of the equation of state for the dark energy. We find that\nthe first generation of low-frequency experiments (such as MWA or LOFAR) will\nbe able to constrain the acoustic scale to within a few percent in a redshift\nwindow just prior to the end of the reionization era, provided that foregrounds\ncan be removed over frequency band-passes of >8MHz. This sensitivity to the\nacoustic scale is comparable to the best current measurements from galaxy\nredshift surveys, but at much higher redshifts. Future extensions of the first\ngeneration experiments (involving an order of magnitude increase in the\nantennae number of the MWA) could reach sensitivities below one percent in\nseveral redshift windows and could be used to study the dark energy in the\nunexplored redshift regime of 3.5<z<12. Moreover, new experiments with antennae\ndesigned to operate at higher frequencies would allow precision measurements\n(<1%) of the acoustic peak to be made at more moderate redshifts (1.5<z<3.5),\nwhere they would be competitive with ambitious spectroscopic galaxy surveys\ncovering more than 1000 square degrees. Together with other data sets,\nobservations of 21cm fluctuations will allow full coverage of the acoustic\nscale from the present time out to z~12.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12631.x	astro-ph	16 pages, 9 figures.

638	0709.3075	Low-temperature phonon thermal conductivity of cuprate single crystals	2007-09-19	\N	Phys. Rev. B 77, 134501 (2008)	  The effect of sample size and surface roughness on the phonon thermal\nconductivity $\\kappa_p$ of Nd$_2$CuO$_4$ single crystals was studied down to 50\nmK. At 0.5 K, $\\kappa_p$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{A}$, where $A$ is the\ncross-sectional area of the sample. This demonstrates that $\\kappa_p$ is\ndominated by boundary scattering below 0.5 K or so. However, the expected $T^3$\ndependence of $\\kappa_p$ is not observed down to 50 mK. Upon roughing the\nsurfaces, the $T^3$ dependence is restored, showing that departures from $T^3$\nare due to specular reflection of phonons off the mirror-like sample surfaces.\nWe propose an empirical power law fit, to $\\kappa_p \\sim T^{\\alpha}$ (where\n$\\alpha < 3$) in cuprate single crystals. Using this method, we show that\nrecent thermal conductivity studies of Zn doping in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$\nre-affirm the universal heat conductivity of d-wave quasiparticles at $T \\to\n0$.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.77.134501	cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el	4 pages, 4 figures

In this paper propagation properties of a parallel-plate waveguide with\ntunable artificial impedance surfaces as sidewalls are studied both\nanalytically and numerically. The impedance surfaces comprise an array of\npatches over a dielectric slab with embedded metallic vias. The tunability of\nsurfaces is achieved with varactors. Simple design equations for tunable\nartificial impedance surfaces as well as dispersion equations for the TE and TM\nmodes are presented. The propagation properties are studied in three different\nregimes: a multi-mode waveguide, a single-mode waveguide, and below-cutoff\nwaveguide. The analytical results are verified with numerical simulations.\n	10.1109/TMTT.2008.925236	physics.class-ph	14 pages

641	0709.3207	Small Scale Magnetic Flux Emergence Observed with Hinode/Solar Optical\n  Telescope	2007-09-20	\N	\N	  We observed small scale magnetic flux emergence in a sunspot moat region by\nthe Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard the Hinode satellite. We analyzed\nfiltergram images observed in the wavelengths of Fe 6302 angstrom, G-band and\nCa II H. In Stokes I images of Fe 6302 angstrom, emerging magnetic flux were\nrecognized as dark lanes. In G-band, they showed their shapes almost the same\nas in Stokes I images. These magnetic flux appeared as dark filaments in Ca II\nH images. Stokes V images of Fe 6302 angstrom showed pairs of opposite\npolarities at footpoints of each filament. These magnetic concentrations are\nidentified to correspond to bright points in G-band/Ca II H images. From the\nanalysis of time-sliced diagrams, we derived following properties of emerging\nflux, which are consistent with the previous works. (1) Two footpoints separate\neach other at a speed of 4.2 km/s during the initial phase of evolution and\ndecreases to about 1 km/s in 10 minutes later. (2) Ca II H filaments appear\nalmost simultaneously with the formation of dark lanes in Stokes I in the\nobservational cadence of 2 minutes. (3) The lifetime of the dark lanes in\nStokes I and G-band is 8 minutes, while that of Ca filament is 12 minutes. An\ninteresting phenomena was observed that an emerging flux tube expands laterally\nin the photosphere with a speed of 3.8 km/s. Discussion on the horizontal\nexpansion of flux tube will be given with refernce to previous simulation\nstudies.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S649	astro-ph	6 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ (Hinode Special\n  Issue)

However,\nthe fraction $f$ of electrons that are coupled to protons and accelerated\nremains unclear and a large number of thermal electrons that are not coupled to\nprotons may be left behind. If $f<1$, the true explosion energies of GRBs are\n$f^{-1}$ times larger than those commonly estimated with $f=1$. Thus the value\nof $f$ gives an important constraint on the nature of the central engine of\nGRBs and the physics of collisionless shocks. Although early-time radio\nobservations can probe the thermal electrons, they are difficult at present. We\nshow that the Faraday rotation effects of the thermal electrons may suppress\nthe linear polarization of the afterglow at frequencies higher than the\nabsorption frequency in the late time, if the magnetic field is ordered at\nleast in parts, and that $f$ can be constrained through the observation of the\neffects. We find that those effects may be detected with late-time, > 1 day,\npolarimetry with ALMA for a burst occurring within 1 Gpc (i.e., z ~ 0.2), if $f\n\\sim 10^{-1}$.\n	10.1086/528740	astro-ph	4 pages, 2 figures, title revised, discussions of section 3 and 5\n  expanded.

643	0709.3372	Two-dimensional Radiation-hydrodynamic Model for Supercritical Disk\n  Accretion Flows onto Neutron Stars	2007-09-21	\N	\N	  We performed two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of\nsupercritical accretion flows around neutron stars (NSs). In contrast with the\naccretion flows onto black holes (BHs), we find that the shell-shaped\nhigh-density regions form around the NSs, since the radiation force is enhanced\nin the innermost regions. The enhanced radiation force drives strong outflows\nabove and below the disk. The mass-accretion rate onto the NS exceeds the\ncritical rate, $L_{\\rm E}/c^2$, with $L_{\\rm E}$ being the Eddington\nluminosity. However it is about $20-30%$ of that onto the BH, under the\ncondition that we employ the same mass-input rate, $\\dot{M}_{\\rm input}$, which\nis mass injected from the outer disk boundary per unit time. The mass-outflow\nrate is a few-times larger in flows around NSs than in flows around BHs. The\nsupercritical NS accretion flows mainly release the accretion energy as the\nkinetic energy of the outflows, though the disk luminosity is predominant over\nthe kinetic energy output rate in the BH accretion flows. The resulting\nvelocity and mass-outflow rate of the outflows are $0.2-0.3c$ and\n$150-700L_{\\rm E}/c^2$, respectively, for the mass-input rate of $3\\times\n10^2\\lsim \\dot{M}_{\\rm input}/(L_{\\rm E}/c^2)\\lsim 3\\times 10^3$. This implies\nthat the SS433 jets can be roughly explained by the supercritical accretion\nonto a NS. However, the collimation angle of the outflows in our simulations\n($\\sim 20^\\circ$) is larger than that of the SS433 jets (a few degrees).\n	10.1093/pasj/59.5.1033	astro-ph	9 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ

We derive\nthe Schr\\"odinger equation for a one-degree-of-freedom system with a constant\nmultiplier. In the sequel we consider the particular example of the simple\nharmonic oscillator. In the case of the general equation for the simple\nharmonic oscillator which contains an arbitrary function we show that all\nSchr\\"odinger equations possess the same number of Lie point symmetries with\nthe same algebra.

645	0709.3404	Optimization of the Asymptotic Property of Mutual Learning Involving an\n  Integration Mechanism of Ensemble Learning	2007-09-21	\N	\N	  We propose an optimization method of mutual learning which converges into the\nidentical state of optimum ensemble learning within the framework of on-line\nlearning, and have analyzed its asymptotic property through the statistical\nmechanics method.The proposed model consists of two learning steps: two\nstudents independently learn from a teacher, and then the students learn from\neach other through the mutual learning. In mutual learning, students learn from\neach other and the generalization error is improved even if the teacher has not\ntaken part in the mutual learning. However, in the case of different initial\noverlaps(direction cosine) between teacher and students, a student with a\nlarger initial overlap tends to have a larger generalization error than that of\nbefore the mutual learning. To overcome this problem, our proposed optimization\nmethod of mutual learning optimizes the step sizes of two students to minimize\nthe asymptotic property of the generalization error. Consequently, the\noptimized mutual learning converges to a generalization error identical to that\nof the optimal ensemble learning. In addition, we show the relationship between\nthe optimum step size of the mutual learning and the integration mechanism of\nthe ensemble learning.\n	10.1143/JPSJ.77.024005	cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech	13 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Journal of Physical Society of\n  Japan
646	0709.3426	Raman imaging and electronic properties of graphene	2007-09-21	\N	Advances of Solid State Physics 47, 171 (2008)	  Graphite is a well-studied material with known electronic and optical\nproperties. Graphene, on the other hand, which is just one layer of carbon\natoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, has been studied theoretically for quite\nsome time but has only recently become accessible for experiments. Here we\ndemonstrate how single- and multi-layer graphene can be unambiguously\nidentified using Raman scattering. Furthermore, we use a scanning Raman set-up\nto image few-layer graphene flakes of various heights. In transport experiments\nwe measure weak localization and conductance fluctuations in a graphene flake\nof about 7 monolayer thickness. We obtain a phase-coherence length of about 2\n$\\mu$m at a temperature of 2 K. Furthermore we investigate the conductivity\nthrough single-layer graphene flakes and the tuning of electron and hole\ndensities via a back gate.\n	10.1007/978-3-540-74325-5_14	cond-mat.mes-hall	\N

B vol.77, 024306 (2008)	  The continuous progress in fabricating low-dimensional systems with large\nspin-orbit couplings has reached a point in which nowadays materials may\ndisplay spin-orbit splitting energies ranging from a few to hundreds of meV.\nThis situation calls for a better understanding of the interplay between the\nspin-orbit coupling and other interactions ubiquitously present in solids, in\nparticular when the spin-orbit splitting is comparable in magnitude with\ncharacteristic energy scales such as the Fermi energy and the phonon frequency.\n  In this article, the two-dimensional Fr\\"ohlich electron-phonon problem is\nreformulated by introducing the coupling to a spin-orbit Rashba potential,\nallowing for a description of the spin-orbit effects on the electron-phonon\ninteraction. The ground state of the resulting Fr\\"ohlich-Rashba polaron is\nstudied in the weak and strong coupling limits of the electron-phonon\ninteraction for arbitrary values of the spin-orbit splitting. The weak coupling\ncase is studied within the Rayleigh-Schr\\"odinger perturbation theory, while\nthe strong-coupling electron-phonon regime is investigated by means of\nvariational polaron wave functions in the adiabatic limit. It is found that,\nfor both weak and strong coupling polarons, the ground state energy is\nsystematically lowered by the spin-orbit interaction, indicating that the\npolaronic character is strengthened by the Rashba coupling. It is also shown\nthat, consistently with the lowering of the ground state, the polaron effective\nmass is enhanced compared to the zero spin-orbit limit. Finally, it is argued\nthat the crossover between weakly and strongly coupled polarons can be shifted\nby the spin-orbit interaction.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.77.024306	cond-mat.str-el	11 pages, 5 figures

We find that there is no dominant power at small spatial scales;\nthe integrated power using the full resolution of Hinode (0.05'' pixels, 0.16''\nresolution) is larger than the power in the data degraded to 0.5'' pixels\n(TRACE pixel size) by only a factor of 1.2. At 20 mHz the ratio is 1.6.\nCombining this result with the estimates of the acoustic flux based on TRACE\ndata of Fossum & Carlsson (2006), we conclude that the total energy flux in\nacoustic waves of frequency 5-40 mHz entering the internetwork chromosphere of\nthe quiet Sun is less than 800 W m$^{-2}$, inadequate to balance the radiative\nlosses in a static chromosphere by a factor of five.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S663	astro-ph	6 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ (special Hinode\n  issue)

651	0709.3644	Radio Source Heating in the ICM: The Example of Cygnus A	2007-09-23	\N	\N	  One of the most promising solutions for the cooling flow problem involves\nenergy injection from the central AGN. However it is still not clear how\ncollimated jets can heat the ICM at large scale, and very little is known\nconcerning the effect of radio lobe expansion as they enter into pressure\nequilibrium with the surrounding cluster gas. Cygnus A is one of the best\nexamples of a nearby powerful radio galaxy for which the synchrotron emitting\nplasma and thermal emitting intra-cluster medium can be mapped in fine detail,\nand previous observations have inferred possible shock structure at the\nlocation of the cocoon. We use new XMM-Newton observations of Cygnus A, in\ncombination with deep Chandra observations, to measure the temperature of the\nintra-cluster medium around the expanding radio cavities.

658	0709.3924	The Hubble Constant	2007-09-25	2014-11-20	\N	  I review the current state of determinations of the Hubble constant, which\ngives the length scale of the Universe by relating the expansion velocity of\nobjects to their distance. There are two broad categories of measurements. The\nfirst uses individual astrophysical objects which have some property that\nallows their intrinsic luminosity or size to be determined, or allows the\ndetermination of their distance by geometric means. The second category\ncomprises the use of all-sky cosmic microwave background, or correlations\nbetween large samples of galaxies, to determine information about the geometry\nof the Universe and hence the Hubble constant, typically in a combination with\nother cosmological parameters. Many, but not all, object-based measurements\ngive $H_0$ values of around 72-74km/s/Mpc , with typical errors of 2-3km/s/Mpc.\nThis is in mild discrepancy with CMB-based measurements, in particular those\nfrom the Planck satellite, which give values of 67-68km/s/Mpc and typical\nerrors of 1-2km/s/Mpc. The size of the remaining systematics indicate that\naccuracy rather than precision is the remaining problem in a good determination\nof the Hubble constant. Whether a discrepancy exists, and whether new physics\nis needed to resolve it, depends on details of the systematics of the\nobject-based methods, and also on the assumptions about other cosmological\nparameters and which datasets are combined in the case of the all-sky methods.\n	10.12942/lrr-2007-4	astro-ph	Extensively revised and updated since the 2007 version: accepted by\n  Living Reviews in Relativity as a major (2014) update of LRR 10, 4, 2007

It is indeed true that data-wise, IFS do sometime merge\nthe characteristics of classic (e.g., long-slit) spectrographs with annoying\nissues associated with Imagers. This is in fact the price to pay to access a\ndrastically different perspective of our favourite targets. The challenge is\nthen to provide the necessary tools to properly handle the corresponding data.\nHowever, this should certainly not be thought as something specific to IFS:\nsuch a challenge should be accepted for any instrument, and most importantly\nsolved prior to its delivery at the telescope.\n	10.1007/978-3-540-76963-7_39	astro-ph	6 pages, 2 figures.

661	0709.4002	Single-electron latch with granular film charge leakage suppressor	2007-09-25	\N	Phys. Rev. B 77, 075414 (2008)	  A single-electron latch is a device that can be used as a building block for\nQuantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) circuits. It consists of three nanoscale\nmetal "dots" connected in series by tunnel junctions; charging of the dots is\ncontrolled by three electrostatic gates. One very important feature of a\nsingle-electron latch is its ability to store ("latch") information represented\nby the location of a single electron within the three dots. To obtain latching,\nthe undesired leakage of charge during the retention time must be suppressed.\nPreviously, to achieve this goal, multiple tunnel junctions were used to\nconnect the three dots. However, this method of charge leakage suppression\nrequires an additional compensation of the background charges affecting each\nparasitic dot in the array of junctions. We report a single-electron latch\nwhere a granular metal film is used to fabricate the middle dot in the latch\nwhich concurrently acts as a charge leakage suppressor. This latch has no\nparasitic dots, therefore the background charge compensation procedure is\ngreatly simplified. We discuss the origins of charge leakage suppression and\npossible applications of granular metal dots for various single-electron\ncircuits.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.77.075414	cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.dis-nn	21 pages, 4 figures

The compatibility\nbetween the operator and the functional approaches is established in full\ngenerality. The intricacies arising in connection with the explicit computation\nof path integrals, for the systems under scrutiny, is illustrated by presenting\nthe detailed calculation of the Feynman kernel for the non-commutative two\ndimensional harmonic oscillator.\n	10.1590/S0103-97332008000200004	hep-th	19 pages, title changed, version to be published in Brazilian Journal\n  of Physics

Graph Algorithms & Applications 17(1): 35-55, 2013	  We consider embeddings of 3-regular graphs into 3-dimensional Cartesian\ncoordinates, in such a way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if two of\ntheir three coordinates are equal (that is, if they lie on an axis-parallel\nline) and such that no three points lie on the same axis-parallel line; we call\na graph with such an embedding an xyz graph}. We describe a correspondence\nbetween xyz graphs and face-colored embeddings of the graph onto\ntwo-dimensional manifolds, and we relate bipartiteness of the xyz graph to\norientability of the underlying topological surface. Using this correspondence,\nwe show that planar graphs are xyz graphs if and only if they are bipartite,\ncubic, and three-connected, and that it is NP-complete to determine whether an\narbitrary graph is an xyz graph. We also describe an algorithm with running\ntime O(n 2^{n/2}) for testing whether a given graph is an xyz graph.\n	10.7155/jgaa.00283	cs.CG math.CO	23 pages, 16 figures.

The Hinode spacecraft and its onboard telescopes were developed to\nallow us to investigate magnetic coupling with co-alignment accuracy better\nthan 1 arcsec. Using the Mercury transit observed on 8 November 2006 and\nco-alignment measurements regularly performed on a weekly basis, we have\ndetermined the information necessary for precise image co-alignment and have\nconfirmed that co-alignment better than 1 arcsec can be realized between Solar\nOptical Telescope (SOT) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) with our baseline\nco-alignment method. This paper presents results from the calibration for\nprecise co-alignment of CCD images from SOT and XRT.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S845	astro-ph	8 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ (Hinode Special\n  issue)

Our proposal is based on\nvertical arrays of quantum dots embedded in a mesoporous material which can be\nfabricated with present technology. We study the feasibility of performing\nquantum computation with different mesoporous matrices. We analyse which matrix\nmaterials ensure that each individual stack of quantum dots can be considered\nisolated from the rest of the ensemble-a key requirement of our scheme. This\nrequirement is satisfied for all matrix materials for feasible structure\nparameters and GaN/AlN based quantum dots.

667	0709.4151	Universal description of the rotational-vibrational spectrum of three\n  particles with zero-range interactions	2007-09-26	2007-10-19	Pis'ma ZhETF 86, 713 (2007)	  A comprehensive universal description of the rotational-vibrational spectrum\nfor two identical particles of mass $m$ and the third particle of the mass\n$m_1$ in the zero-range limit of the interaction between different particles is\ngiven for arbitrary values of the mass ratio $m/m_1$ and the total angular\nmomentum $L$. If the two-body scattering length is positive, a number of\nvibrational states is finite for $L_c(m/m_1) \\le L \\le L_b(m/m_1)$, zero for\n$L>L_b(m/m_1)$, and infinite for $L<L_c(m/m_1)$. If the two-body scattering\nlength is negative, a number of states is either zero for $L \\ge L_c(m/m_1)$ or\ninfinite for $L<L_c(m/m_1)$. For a finite number of vibrational states, all the\nbinding energies are described by the universal function $\\epsilon_{LN}(m/m_1)\n= {\\cal E}(\\xi, \\eta)$, where $\\xi=\\displaystyle\\frac{N-1/2}{\\sqrt{L(L + 1)}}$,\n$\\eta=\\displaystyle\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{m_1 L (L + 1)}}$,and $N$ is the vibrational\nquantum number. This scaling dependence is in agreement with the numerical\ncalculations for $L > 2$ and only slightly deviates from those for $L = 1, 2$.\nThe universal description implies that the critical values $L_c(m/m_1)$ and\n$L_b(m/m_1)$ increase as $0.401 \\sqrt{m/m_1}$ and $0.563 \\sqrt{m/m_1}$,\nrespectively, while a number of vibrational states for $L \\ge L_c(m/m_1)$ is\nwithin the range $N \\le N_{max} \\approx 1.1 \\sqrt{L(L+1)}+1/2$.\n	10.1134/S002136400722002X	physics.atom-ph	\N

669	0709.4236	HST search for M subdwarf binaries	2007-09-26	\N	\N	  We present HST/ACS observations of 19 nearby M subdwarfs in a search for\nbinary systems. Other than the wide common proper motion pair LHS 2140/2139,\nnone of our sdM and esdM targets are found to be binaries. Our survey is\nsensitive to equal-luminosity companions at close (2-8 AU) separations, while\nsub-stellar secondaries could have been detected at separations in the range of\n6-30 AU. To check for wide binaries, we have compared the POSS I and II images\nin a field of view as large as 10'x10', but could not detect a single co-moving\nstar for any of the targets. Combining our results with those from Gizis &\nReid, we have a binary fraction of 3% (1/28). Detection of a small number of M\nsubdwarf binaries reported in the literature suggests a higher fraction than\nthe one obtained here, probably comparable to that found for the more massive\nsolar-type stars in the halo (13-15%). Comparison with the disk M dwarf\nfraction (25%) however suggests multiplicity to be rare among the lowest mass\nhalo stars, implying the two populations formed under different initial\nconditions. The low binary fraction in our survey could be explained by\nselection biases. A decrease in multiplicity has been observed in the disk for\nmasses below 0.1Msun, the peak in the disk mass function (MF). The globular\ncluster MF is found to peak at about 0.33Msun, with a decrease in the number of\nstars per unit mass below the peak mass. Our sample being composed of stars\nwith masses between ~0.2 and 0.085 Msun suggests that a decrease in\nmultiplicity similar to the disk may also be true for the halo stars, but\nperhaps below a mass of ~0.3Msun. A higher M subdwarf binary fraction may be\nobtained if the selected primaries have masses near or higher than the peak in\nthe MF.\n	10.1086/523931	astro-ph	15 pages, accepted in ApJ

The focus of our work is to identify conditions for the presence of an\nisotropic-nematic phase transition in the context of a generic system with\nisotropic competing interactions.

The analysis is restricted to the\nstripe phase and does not apply to the central result of our letter. We show,\ncontrary to what is suggested in the comment, that the model introduced by D.\nG.

By considering the Hawking and Ellis\nextended interpretation of the KN spacetime, as well as Wheeler's idea of\n"charge without charge", the non-trivial topological structure of the extended\nKN spatial section is found to represent gravitational states with\nhalf-integral angular momentum. As a consequence, it can be consistently\ninterpreted as a model for the electron-positron system, in which the concepts\nof mass, charge and spin emerge from the spacetime geometry. According to this\nmodel, therefore, instead of a simple arena, spacetime must have a concrete\nexistence, being responsible -- through its highly non-trivial topological\nstructures -- for the building blocks of (at least some of) the existing matter\nin the universe.\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-6318-3_12	gr-qc hep-th	Chapter in the book "Relativity and the Dimensionality of the World",\n  Springer series "Fundamental Theories of Physics", Vol. 153 (2007).

We verified the fourth-order\nconvergence of some well known algorithms by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation numerically. All such splitting algorithms suffer from a latent\nnumerical instability even when the total energy is very well conserved. A\ndetail error analysis reveals that the noise, or elementary excitations of the\nnonlinear Schr\\"odinger, obeys the Bogoliubov spectrum and the instability is\ndue to the exponential growth of high wave number noises caused by the\nsplitting process. For a continuum wave function, this instability is\nunavoidable no matter how small the time step. For a discrete wave function,\nthe instability can be avoided only for $\\dt k_{max}^2{<\\atop\\sim}2 \\pi$, where\n$k_{max}=\\pi/\\Delta x$.\n	10.1103/PhysRevE.76.056708	physics.comp-ph physics.atom-ph	10 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Phys.

681	0710.0428	Nature of time and causality in Physics	2007-10-01	2008-02-14	Psychology of Time, 395-422, (2008)	  The conceptual definition and understanding of the nature of time, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively is of the utmost difficulty and importance,\nand plays a fundamental role in physics. Physical systems seem to evolve in\npaths of increasing entropy and of complexity, and thus, the arrow of time\nshall be explored in the context of thermodynamic irreversibility and quantum\nphysics. In Newtonian physics, time flows at a constant rate, the same for all\nobservers; however, it necessarily flows at different rates for different\nobservers in special and general relativity. Special relativity provides\nimportant quantitative elucidations of the fundamental processes related to\ntime dilation effects, and general relativity provides a deep analysis to\neffects of time flow, such as in the presence of gravitational fields. Through\nthe special theory of relativity, time became intimately related with space,\ngiving rise to the notion of spacetime, in which both parameters cannot be\nconsidered as separate entities. As time is incorporated into the proper\nstructure of the fabric of spacetime, it is interesting to note that general\nrelativity is contaminated with non-trivial geometries that generate closed\ntimelike curves, and thus apparently violates causality. The notion of\ncausality is fundamental in the construction of physical theories; therefore\ntime travel and its associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution.\nThese issues are briefly analyzed in this review paper.\n	\N	gr-qc	14 pages, 11 figures.

Their density is proportional to the density of catalyzing\nMnAs nanoislands, which can be controlled by the Mn flux and/or the substrate\ntemperature. Being rooted in the ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As, the\nnanowires combine one-dimensional properties with the magnetic properties of\n(Ga,Mn)As and provide natural, self assembled structures for nanospintronics.\n	10.1021/nl071190f	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	13 pages, 6 figures

691	0710.0988	Confront Holographic QCD with Regge Trajectories of vectors and\n  axial-vectors	2007-10-04	2008-12-06	\N	  We derive the general 5-dimension metric structure of the $Dp-Dq$ system in\ntype II superstring theory, and demonstrate the physical meaning of the\nparameters characterizing the 5-dimension metric structure of the\n\\textit{holographic} QCD model by relating them to the parameters describing\nRegge trajectories. By matching the spectra of vector mesons $\\rho_1$ with\ndeformed $Dp-Dq$ soft-wall model, we find that the spectra of vector mesons\n$\\rho_1$ can be described very well in the soft-wall $D3-Dq$ model, i.e,\n$AdS_5$ soft-wall model. We then investigate how well the $AdS_5$ soft-wall\nmodel can describe the Regge trajectory of axial-vector mesons $a_1$. We find\nthat the constant component of the 5-dimension mass square of axial-vector\nmesons plays an efficient role to realize the chiral symmetry breaking in the\nvacuum, and a small negative $z^4$ correction in the 5-dimension mass square is\nhelpful to realize the chiral symmetry restoration in high excitation states.\n	10.1140/epjc/s10052-010-1239-0	hep-ph hep-th nucl-th	9 pages, 3 figure and 3 tables, one section added

For that we give a procedure which, starting with a term\ntyped in system F, determines whether it is typable in DLAL and outputs a\nconcrete typing if there exists any. We show that our procedure can be run in\ntime polynomial in the size of the original Church typed system F term.\n	10.2168/LMCS-3(4:10)2007	cs.LO cs.CC	32 pages, 8 figures

Jpn. 77, 024004 (2008)	  A new Monte-Carlo method for long-range interacting systems is presented.\nThis method consists of eliminating interactions stochastically with the\ndetailed balance condition satisfied. When a pairwise interaction $V_{ij}$ of a\n$N$-particle system decreases with the distance as $r_{ij}^{-\\alpha}$,\ncomputational time per one Monte Carlo step is ${\\cal O}(N)$ for $\\alpha \\ge d$\nand ${\\cal O}(N^{2-\\alpha/d})$ for $\\alpha < d$, where $d$ is the spatial\ndimension. We apply the method to a two-dimensional magnetic dipolar system.\nThe method enables us to treat a huge system of $256^2$ spins with reasonable\ncomputational time, and reproduces a circular order originated from long-range\ndipolar interactions.\n	10.1143/JPSJ.77.024004	cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech	18 pages, 9 figures, 1 figure and 1 reference are added
694	0710.1225	Evidence of the virtual Anderson transition in a narrow impurity band of\n  p-GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells: $\\epsilon_4$ conductivity and electric breakdown\n  at low temperatures	2007-10-05	\N	\N	  In highly doped uncompensated p-type layers within the central part of\nGaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells at low temperatures we observed an activated behavior\nof the conductivity with low activation energies (1-3) meV which can not be\nascribed to standard mechanisms. We attribute this behavior to the\ndelocalization of hole states near the maximum of the narrow impurity band in\nthe sense of the Anderson transition. Low temperature conduction $\\epsilon_4$\nis supported by an activation of minority carriers - electrons (resulting from\na weak compensation by back-ground defects) - from the Fermi level to the band\nof delocalized states mentioned above. The corresponding behavior can be\nspecified as virtual Anderson transition. Low temperature transport ($<4$ K)\nexhibits also strong nonlinearity of a breakdown type characterized in\nparticular by S-shaped I-V curve. The nonlinearity is observed in unexpectedly\nlow fields ($<10$ V/cm). Such a behavior can be explained by a simple model\nimplying an impact ionization of the localized states of the minority carriers\nmentioned above to the band of Anderson-delocalized states.\n	10.1002/pssc.200777550	cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.mtrl-sci	9 pages, 6 fig

Phys. 100, 084306 (2006)	  Optoelectronic measurements of carbon nanotube transistors have shown a wide\nvariety of sensitivites to the incident light. Direct photocurrent processes\ncompete with a number of extrinsic mechanisms. Here we show that visible light\nabsorption in the silicon substrate generates a photovoltage that can\nelectrically gate the nanotube device. The photocurrent induced by the changing\ngate voltage can be significantly larger than that due to direct electron-hole\npair generation in the nanotube. The dominance of photogating in these devices\nis confirmed by the power and position dependence of the resulting\nphotocurrent. The power dependence is strongly non-linear and photocurrents are\nmeasured through the device even when the laser illuminates up to 1~mm from the\nnanotube.\n	10.1063/1.2357413	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	18 pages, 7 figures
696	0710.1310	EVLA Observations of OH Masers in ON 1	2007-10-05	\N	\N	  This Letter reports on initial Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) observations\nof the 6035 MHz masers in ON 1. The EVLA data are of good quality, lending\nconfidence in the new receiver system. Nineteen maser features, including six\nZeeman pairs, are detected. The overall distribution of 6035 MHz OH masers is\nsimilar to that of the 1665 MHz OH masers. The spatial resolution is sufficient\nto unambiguously determine that the magnetic field is strong (~ -10 mG) at the\nlocation of the blueshifted masers in the north, consistent with Zeeman\nsplitting detected in 13441 MHz OH masers in the same velocity range. Left and\nright circularly polarized ground-state features dominate in different regions\nin the north of the source, which may be due to a combination of magnetic field\nand velocity gradients. The combined distribution of all OH masers toward the\nsouth is suggestive of a shock structure of the sort previously seen in W3(OH).\n	10.1086/524136	astro-ph	4 pages using emulateapj.cls including 2 tables and 2 color figures
697	0710.1331	Resonance Related Spiral Substructure in a Galactic Gaseous Disk	2007-10-05	2007-10-25	\N	  We use high resolution 2D hydrodynamic simulations to study the formation of\nspiral substructure in the gaseous disk of a galaxy. The obtained gaseous\nresponse is driven by a self-consistent non-axisymmetric potential obtained\nfrom an imposed spiral mass distribution. We highlight the importance of\nultraharmonic resonances in generating these features. The temporal evolution\nof the system is followed with the parallel ZEUS-MP code, and we follow the\nsteepening of perturbations induced by the spiral potential until large-scale\nshocks emerge. These shocks exhibit bifurcations that protrude from the gaseous\narms and continue to steepen until new shocks are formed. When the contribution\nfrom the spiral potential relative to the axisymmetric background is increased\nfrom our default value, spurs protrude from the main arms after several\nrevolutions of the gaseous disk. Such spurs overlap on top of the\naforementioned shocks. These results support the hypothesis that a complicated\ngaseous response can coexist with an orderly spiral potential term, in the\nsense that the underlying background potential can be smooth yet drive a\ngaseous response that is far more spatially complex.\n	10.1086/523930	astro-ph	18 pages, 4 figures.

The saturation of the magnetic susceptibility below 300\nmK observed in the muon spin resonance ($\\mu$SR) experiment is the quantum\neffect of the spin flipping process.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.77.172404	cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.stat-mech	4 pages, 5 figures
706	0710.1579	Antiferro-quadrupole state of orbital-degenerate Kondo lattice model\n  with f^2 configuration	2007-10-08	\N	J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 77 Suppl. A, 199 (2008)	  To clarify a key role of $f$ orbitals in the emergence of\nantiferro-quadrupole structure in PrPb$_{3}$, we investigate the ground-state\nproperty of an orbital-degenerate Kondo lattice model by numerical\ndiagonalization techniques. In PrPb$_{3}$, Pr$^{3+}$ has a $4f^{2}$\nconfiguration and the crystalline-electric-field ground state is a non-Kramers\ndoublet $\\Gamma_{3}$. In a $j$-$j$ coupling scheme, the $\\Gamma_{3}$ state is\ndescribed by two local singlets, each of which consists of two $f$ electrons\nwith one in $\\Gamma_{7}$ and another in $\\Gamma_{8}$ orbitals. Since in a cubic\nstructure, $\\Gamma_{7}$ has localized nature, while $\\Gamma_{8}$ orbitals are\nrather itinerant, we propose the orbital-degenerate Kondo lattice model for an\neffective Hamiltonian of PrPb$_{3}$. We show that an antiferro-orbital state is\nfavored by the so-called double-exchange mechanism which is characteristic of\nmulti-orbital systems.\n	10.1143/JPSJS.77SA.199	cond-mat.str-el	3 pages, 3 figures, Proceedings of Skutterudite2007 (September 26-30,\n  2007, Kobe)
699	0710.1389	Comparison of two experiments on radiative neutron decay	2007-10-06	\N	\N	  Over 10 years ago we proposed an experiment on measuring the characteristics\nof radiative neutron decay in papers [1, 2]. At the same time we had published\nthe theoretical spectrum of radiative gamma quanta, calculated within the\nframework of the electroweak interactions, on the basis of which we proposed\nthe methodology for the future experiment [3,4]. However, because we were\ndenied beam time on the intensive cold neutron beam at ILL (Grenoble, France)\nfor a number of years, we could only conduct the experiment in 2005 on the\nnewly opened FRMII reactor of Technical University of Muenchen. The main result\nof this experiment was the discovery of radiative neutron decay and the\nmeasurement of its relative intensity B.R.= (3.2+-1.6)10-3 with C.L.=99.7% for\nradiative gamma quanta with energy over 35 kev [5,6]. Over a year after our\nfirst announcement about the results of the conducted experiment, "Nature" [7]\npublished a letter asserting that its authors have also measured the branching\nratio of radiative neutron decay B.R.= (3.13+-0.34)10-3 with C.L.=68% and gamma\nquanta energy from 15 to 340 kev. This article aims to compare these two\nexperiments. It is shown that the use of strong magnetic fields in the NIST\n(Washington, USA) experiment methodology not only prevents any exact\nmeasurement of the branching ratio and identification of radiative neutron\ndecay events, but also makes registration of ordinary neutron decay events\nimpossible.\n	10.1134/S1063778809120072	nucl-ex	contribution on conference ISINN-15
700	0710.1393	A Measurement of Proper Motions of SiO Maser Sources in the Galactic\n  Center with the VLBA	2007-10-06	\N	\N	  We report on the high-precision astrometric observations of maser sources\naround the Galactic Center in the SiO J=1--0 v=1 and 2 lines with the VLBA\nduring 2001 -- 2004. With phase-referencing interferometry referred to the\nradio continuum source Sgr A*, accurate positions of masers were obtained for\nthree detected objects: IRS 10 EE (7 epochs), IRS 15NE (2 epochs), and SiO 6\n(only 1 epoch). Because circumstellar masers of these objects were resolved\ninto several components, proper motions for the maser sources were derived with\nseveral different methods. Combining our VLBA results with those of the\nprevious VLA observations, we obtained the IRS 10EE proper motion of 76+-3 km\ns^{-1} (at 8 kpc) to the south relative to Sgr A*. Almost null proper motion of\nthis star in the east--west direction results in a net transverse motion of the\ninfrared reference frame of about 30+-9 km s^{-1} to the west relative to Sgr\nA*. The proper-motion data also suggests that IRS 10EE is an astrometric binary\nwith an unseen massive companion.\n	10.1093/pasj/60.1.11	astro-ph	High-res. figures are available at\n  ftp://ftp.nro.nao.ac.jp/nroreport/no656.pdf.gz .

701	0710.1395	Mapping the Spatial Distribution of Charge Carriers in LaAlO3/SrTiO3\n  Heterostructures	2007-10-06	2008-03-31	\N	  At the interface between complex insulating oxides, novel phases with\ninteresting properties may occur, such as the metallic state reported in the\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 system. While this state has been predicted and reported to be\nconfined at the interface, some works indicate a much broader spatial\nextension, thereby questioning its origin. Here we provide for the first time a\ndirect determination of the carrier density profile of this system through\nresistance profile mappings collected in cross-section LaAlO3/SrTiO3 samples\nwith a conducting-tip atomic force microscope (CT-AFM). We find that, depending\nupon specific growth protocols, the spatial extension of the high-mobility\nelectron gas can be varied from hundreds of microns into SrTiO3 to a few\nnanometers next to the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. Our results emphasize the\npotential of CT-AFM as a novel tool to characterize complex oxide interfaces\nand provide us with a definitive and conclusive way to reconcile the body of\nexperimental data in this system.\n	10.1038/nmat2223	cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.str-el	This updated version contains new experimental data

On the way, we define a class of\nsubmanifolds called pseudo balls, defined by an equation weaker than constancy\nof mean curvature. We show that in a neighborhood of each point of a compact\nriemannian manifold, there is a unique family concentric pseudo balls which\ncontains all the pseudo balls $C^{2,\\alpha}$-close to small spheres. This\nallows us to reduce the isoperimetric problem for small volumes to a\nvariational problem in finite dimension.\n	10.1007/s10455-008-9152-6	math.DG	43 pages

We focus on two such mechanisms,\nemphasizing their generality and illustrating each of them via a representative\nexample. The first example belongs to a recently discovered class of integrable\nindeed solvable many-body problems. The second example consists of a broad\nclass of (generally nonintegrable) models obtained by deforming appropriately\nthe well-known (integrable and isochronous) many-body problem with inverse-cube\ntwo-body forces and a one-body linear ("harmonic oscillator") force.\n	10.2991/jnmp.2008.15.4.5	nlin.SI math-ph math.DS math.MP	18 pages, 3 figures

The case in which the solvable\nHamiltonian corresponds to the harmonic oscillator is emphasized. We show that,\nin spite of the similarities at the classical level, the quantum evolution is\nvery different. In particular, this difference is important in constructing\ncoherent states, which is impossible in most cases. The class of Hamiltonians\nwe consider is interesting due to its pedagogical value and its applicability\nto some open research problems in quantum optics and quantum gravity.\n	10.1119/1.2805234	quant-ph	Accepted for publication in American Journal of Physics
707	0710.1657	Manipulating Biopolymer Dynamics by Anisotropic Nanoconfinement	2007-10-08	2007-10-09	\N	  How the geometry of nano-sized confinement affects dynamics of biomaterials\nis interesting yet poorly understood. An elucidation of structural details upon\nnano-sized confinement may benefit manufacturing pharmaceuticals in biomaterial\nsciences and medicine. The behavior of biopolymers in nano-sized confinement is\ninvestigated using coarse-grained models and molecular simulations.\nParticularly, we address the effects of shapes of a confinement on protein\nfolding dynamics by measuring folding rates and dissecting structural\nproperties of the transition states in nano-sized spheres and ellipsoids. We\nfind that when the form of a confinement resembles the geometrical properties\nof the transition states, the rates of folding kinetics are most enhanced.

708	0710.1705	Dimensionality and morphology of particle and bubble clusters in\n  turbulent flow	2007-10-09	2008-02-05	J. Fluid Mech. 607, pp. 13 - 24, (2008)	  We conduct numerical experiments to investigate the spatial clustering of\nparticles and bubbles in simulations of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence.\nVarying the Stokes parameter and the densities, striking differences in the\nclustering of the particles can be observed. To quantify these visual findings\nwe use the Kaplan--Yorke dimension. This local scaling analysis shows a\ndimension of approximately 1.4 for the light bubble distribution, whereas the\ndistribution of very heavy particles shows a dimension of approximately 2.4.\nHowever, clearly separate parameter combinations yield the same dimensions. To\novercome this degeneracy and to further develop the understanding of\nclustering, we perform a morphological (geometrical and topological) analysis\nof the particle distribution. For such an analysis, Minkowski functionals have\nbeen successfully employed in cosmology, in order to quantify the global\ngeometry and topology of the large-scale distribution of galaxies. In the\ncontext of dispersed multiphase flow, these Minkowski functionals -- being\nmorphological order parameters -- allow us to discern the filamentary structure\nof the light particle distribution from the wall-like distribution of heavy\nparticles around empty interconnected tunnels.\n	10.1017/S0022112008001936	nlin.CD physics.flu-dyn	12 pages, 8 figures

We show that in this limit the gravitational theory can be\nreformulated in terms of billiard motion in a region of hyperbolic space,\nrevealing that the dynamics is completely determined by a (possibly infinite)\nsequence of reflections, which are elements of a Lorentzian Coxeter group. Such\nCoxeter groups are the Weyl groups of infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody algebras,\nsuggesting that these algebras yield symmetries of gravitational theories. Our\npresentation is aimed to be a self-contained and comprehensive treatment of the\nsubject, with all the relevant mathematical background material introduced and\nexplained in detail. We also review attempts at making the infinite-dimensional\nsymmetries manifest, through the construction of a geodesic sigma model based\non a Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra. An explicit example is provided for the case\nof the hyperbolic algebra E10, which is conjectured to be an underlying\nsymmetry of M-theory.

713	0710.1830	Structural efficiency of percolation landscapes in flow networks	2007-10-09	\N	\N	  Complex networks characterized by global transport processes rely on the\npresence of directed paths from input to output nodes and edges, which organize\nin characteristic linked components. The analysis of such network-spanning\nstructures in the framework of percolation theory, and in particular the key\nrole of edge interfaces bridging the communication between core and periphery,\nallow us to shed light on the structural properties of real and theoretical\nflow networks, and to define criteria and quantities to characterize their\nefficiency at the interplay between structure and functionality. In particular,\nit is possible to assess that an optimal flow network should look like a "hairy\nball", so to minimize bottleneck effects and the sensitivity to failures.\nMoreover, the thorough analysis of two real networks, the Internet\ncustomer-provider set of relationships at the autonomous system level and the\nnervous system of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans --that have been shaped by\nvery different dynamics and in very different time-scales--, reveals that\nwhereas biological evolution has selected a structure close to the optimal\nlayout, market competition does not necessarily tend toward the most customer\nefficient architecture.\n	10.1371/journal.pone.0003654	cond-mat.dis-nn physics.soc-ph	8 pages, 5 figures
715	0710.1913	JVN observations of H2O masers around the evolved star IRAS 22480+6002	2007-10-10	\N	\N	  We report on the H2O maser distributions around IRAS 22480+6002 (=IRC+60370)\nobserved with the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) at three epochs spanning 2\nmonths. This object was identified as a K-type supergiant in 1970s, which was\nunusual as a stellar maser source. The spectrum of H2O masers consists of 5\npeaks separated roughly equally by a few km/s each. The H2O masers were\nspatially resolved into more than 15 features, which spread about 50 mas along\nthe east--west direction. However, no correlation was found between the proper\nmotion vectors and their spatial distributions; the velocity field of the\nenvelope seems random.

Bounding techniques are widely used to evaluate the\nperformance of maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm. But the existing bounds\nare not tight enough especially for low signal-to-noise ratios and become\nlooser when a suboptimum decoding algorithm is used. This paper proposes a new\nconcept named square radius probability density function (SR-PDF) of decision\nregion to evaluate the WER. Based on the SR-PDF, The WER of binary block codes\ncan be calculated precisely for ML and suboptimum decoders. Furthermore, for a\nlong binary block code, SR-PDF can be approximated by Gamma distribution with\nonly two parameters that can be measured easily. Using this property, two\nclosed-form approximative expressions are proposed which are very close to the\nsimulation results of the WER of interesting.\n	\N	cs.IT math.IT	I tried to fix the problem that figures cannot be displayed in\n  Version1~3, but it doesnot work.

717	0710.1953	Strong Reduction of the Field-Dependent Microwave Surface Resistance in\n  YBCO with BaZrO_3 Inclusions	2007-10-10	\N	\N	  We present measurements of the magnetic field dependent microwave surface\nresistance in laser-ablated YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ films on SrTiO$_3$\nsubstrates. BaZrO$_3$ crystallites were included in the films using composite\ntargets containing BaZrO$_3$ inclusions with mean grain size smaller than 1\n$\\mu$m. X-ray diffraction showed single epitaxial relationship between\nBaZrO$_3$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$. The effective surface resistance was\nmeasured at 47.7 GHz for 60$< T <$90 K and 0$< \\mu_0H <$0.8 T. The magnetic\nfield had a very different effect on pristine YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ and\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$/BaZrO$_3$, while for $\\mu_0H=$0 only a reduction of\n$T_c$ in the YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$/BaZrO$_3$ film was observed,\nconsistent with dc measurements. At low enough $T$, in moderate fields\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$/BaZrO$_3$ exhibited an intrinsic thin film\nresistance lower than the pure film. The results clearly indicate that\nBaZrO$_3$ inclusions determine a strong reduction of the field-dependent\nsurface resistance. From the analysis of the data in the framework of simple\nmodels for the microwave surface impedance in the mixed state we argue that\nBaZrO$_3$ inclusions determine very steep pinning potentials.\n	10.1088/1742-6596/97/1/012173	cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.mtrl-sci	LaTeX, 6 pages, 4 figures, uses jpconf.cls and jpconf11.clo class\n  files, talk given at EUCAS 2007, submitted to J.

721	0710.2133	Resolving the Outer Disks and Halos of Nearby Galaxies	2007-10-11	\N	\N	  In a hierarchical merging scenario, the outer parts of a galaxy are a fossil\nrecord of the galaxy's early history. Observations of the outer disks and halos\nof galaxies thus provide a tool to study individual galaxy histories and test\nformation theories. Locally, an impressive effort has been made to understand\nthe halo of the Milky Way, Andromeda, and M33. However, due to the stochastic\nnature of halo formation, a better understanding of this process requires a\nlarge sample of galaxies with known halo properties. The GHOSTS project (PI: R.\nde Jong) aims to characterize the halos and outer portions of 14 nearby (D=4-14\nMpc) spiral galaxies using the Hubble Space Telescope. Detection of individual\nstars in the outer parts of these galaxies enables us to study both the\nmorphological properties of the galaxies, and determine the stars' metallicity\nand age.\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_26	astro-ph	Contributed talk; to appear in the proceedings of "Galaxies in the\n  Local Volume" Sydney 8-13 July 2007

It turns out that\nthere is manifest isospin asymmetry in eta photoproduction, which can be\nexplained by the asymmetry in the transition magnetic moments: mu_{gamma p p*}\n=<mu_{gamma n n*}. Moreover, we find that the spin-1/2 state is preferred and\nthis observation implies that the new resonance may be identified as a\nnon-strangeness member of the baryon antidecuplet.\n	10.1007/978-3-540-85144-8_36	hep-ph	6 pages, 16 figures, Talk given at International Workshop NSTAR2007,\n  5~8 Sep. 2007, Bonn, Germany, to appear in EPJ

726	0710.2397	Initial-Final Mass Relationship for Stars of Different Metallicities	2007-10-12	2008-05-20	\N	  Following Paczy\\'{n}ski & Zi\\'{o}lkowski (1968) and Han et al. (1994), we\nassume that the envelope of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or a first giant\nbranch (FGB) star is lost when the binding energy of the envelope is equal to\nzero ($\\Delta W=0$) and the core mass of the AGB star or the FGB star at the\npoint ($\\Delta W=0$) is taken as the final mass. Using this assumption, we\ncalculate the IFMRs for stars of different metallicities.We find that the IFMRs\ndepends strongly on the metallicity, i.e. $Z=0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.004,\n0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08$ and 0.1. From $Z=0.04$, the final\nmass of the stars with a given initial mass increases with increasing or\ndecreasing metallicity. The difference of the final mass due to the metallicity\nmay be up to 0.4 $M_{\\odot}$. A linear fit of the initial-final mass\nrelationship in NGC 2099 (M37) shows a potential evidence of the effect of\nmetallicity on the IFMR. The IFMR for stars of $Z=0.02$ obtained in the paper\nmatches well with those inferred observationally in the Galaxy. For $Z\\geq\n0.02$, helium WDs are obtained from the stars of $M_{\\rm i}\\leq 1.0 M_{\\odot}$\nand this result is upheld by the discovery of numerous low-mass WDs in NGC 6791\nwhich is a metal-rich old open cluster. Using the IFMR for stars of $Z=0.02$\nobtained in the paper, we have reproduced the mass distribution of DA WDs in\nSloan DR4 except for some ultra-massive white dwarfs. The trend that the mean\nmass of WDs decreases with effective temperature may originate from the\nincrease of the initial metallicities of stars. We predict that metal-rich\nlow-mass stars may become under-massive white dwarfs.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20078841	astro-ph	14 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A

In this paper we claim to identify one underlying mathematical\nstructure behind these "trace semantics," namely coinduction in a Kleisli\ncategory. This claim is based on our technical result that, under a suitably\norder-enriched setting, a final coalgebra in a Kleisli category is given by an\ninitial algebra in the category Sets. Formerly the theory of coalgebras has\nbeen employed mostly in Sets where coinduction yields a finer process semantics\nof bisimilarity.

Lumin. 128, 956 (2008)	  The study of energy harvesting in chain-like structures is important due to\nits relevance to a variety of interesting physical systems. Harvesting is\nunderstood as the combination of exciton transport through intra-band exciton\nrelaxation (via scattering on phonon modes) and subsequent quenching by a trap.\nPreviously, we have shown that in the low temperature limit different\nharvesting scenarios as a function of the applied bias strength (slope of the\nenergy gradient towards the trap) are possible \\cite{Vlaming07}. This paper\ngeneralizes the results for both homogeneous and disordered chains to nonzero\ntemperatures. We show that thermal effects are appreciable only for low bias\nstrengths, particularly so in disordered systems, and lead to faster\nharvesting.\n	10.1016/j.jlumin.2007.11.038	cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.mtrl-sci	8 pages, 2 fugures, to appear in Journal of Luminescence

An important first step in the process was the application of data\ncleaning and disambiguation methods to construct a unified database, since the\ndata were too noisy to be of full utility in the raw form initially available.\nThe resulting co-author graph in 2006, for example, had 39,645 nodes (with an\nestimated 6% error rate in our disambiguation of similar author names) and\n13,979 abstracts, with an average of 1.5 abstracts per author, 4.3 authors per\nabstract, and 5.96 collaborators per author (including all authors on shared\nabstracts). Recent work in related areas has focused on reputational indices\nsuch as highly cited papers or scientists and journal impact factors, and to a\nlesser extent on creating visual maps of the knowledge space. In contrast,\nthere has been relatively less work on the demographics and community\nstructure, the dynamics of the field over time to examine major research trends\nand the structure of the sources of research funding. In this paper we examined\neach of these areas in order to gain an objective overview of contemporary\nneuroscience. Some interesting findings include a high geographical\nconcentration of neuroscience research in north eastern United States, a\nsurprisingly large transient population (60% of the authors appear in only one\nout of the six studied years), the central role played by the study of\nneurodegenerative disorders in the neuroscience community structure, and an\napparent growth of behavioral/systems neuroscience with a corresponding\nshrinkage of cellular/molecular neuroscience over the six year period.\n	10.1371/journal.pone.0002052	physics.data-an q-bio.NC	\N

A, pp. 140-143	  We investigated the non centrosymmetric superconductors CePt$_3$Si and UIr by\nthe ac heat capacity measurement under pressures. We determined the pressure\nphase diagrams of these compounds. In CePt$_3$Si, the N\\'{e}el temperature\n$T_{\\rm N}$ = 2.2 K decreases with increasing pressure and becomes zero at the\ncritical pressure $P_{\\rm AF}$ $\\simeq$ 0.6 GPa. On the other hand, the\nsuperconducting phase exists in a wider pressure region from ambient pressure\nto $P_{\\rm AF}$ $\\simeq$ 1.5 GPa. The phase diagram of CePt$_3$Si is very\nunique and has never been reported before for other heavy fermion\nsuperconductors. In UIr, the heat capacity shows an anomaly at the Curie\ntemperature $T_{\\rm C1}$ = 46 K at ambient pressure, and the heat capacity\nanomaly shifts to lower temperatures with increasing pressure. The present\npressure dependence of $T_{\\rm C1}$ was consistent with the previous studies by\nthe resistivity and magnetization measurements.

735	0710.2702	Blob formation and acceleration in the solar wind: role of converging\n  flows and viscosity	2007-10-14	\N	\N	  The effect of viscosity and of converging flows on the formation of blobs in\nthe slow solar wind is analysed by means of resistive MHD simulations. The\nregions above coronal streamers where blobs are formed (Sheeley et al., 1997)\nare simulated using a model previously proposed by Einaudi et al. (1999). The\nresult of our investigation is twofold. First, we demonstrate a new mechanism\nfor enhanced momentum transfer between a forming blob and the fast solar wind\nsurrounding it. The effect is caused by the longer range of the electric field\ncaused by the tearing instability forming the blob. The electric field reaches\ninto the fast solar wind and interacts with it, causing a viscous drag that is\nglobal in nature rather than local across fluid layers as it is the case in\nnormal uncharged fluids (like water). Second, the presence of a magnetic cusp\nat the tip of a coronal helmet streamer causes a converging of the flows on the\ntwo sides of the streamer and a direct push of the forming island by the fast\nsolar wind, resulting in a more efficient momentum exchange.\n	10.5194/angeo-26-3049-2008	astro-ph	\N

B, Vol 79, pp 085410 (2009)	  The objective of this paper is to point out that contact induced states can\nhelp explain the structure dependence of the minimum conductivity observed\nexperimentally even if the samples were purely ballistic. Contact induced\nstates are similar to the well-known metal induced gap states (MIGS) in\nmetal-semiconductor Schottky junctions, which typically penetrate only a few\natomic lengths into the semiconductor, while the depth of penetration decreases\nwith increasing band gap. However, in graphene we find that these states\npenetrate a much longer distance of the order of the width of the contacts. As\na result, ballistic graphene samples with a length less than their width can\nexhibit a resistance proportional to length that is not Ohmic in origin, but\narises from a reduced role of contact-induced states. While actual samples are\nprobably not ballistic and involve scattering processes, our results show that\nthese contact induced effects need to be taken into account in interpreting\nexperiments and minimum conductivity depends strongly on the structure and\nconfiguration (two- vs. four-terminal) used.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.79.085410	cond-mat.mes-hall	4 pages, 4 figures

The model incorporates effects due to the current induced Oersted\nfield and predicts the generation of a variety of spatially dependent,\ncoherent, precessional magnetic wave structures. Directionally controllable\ncollimated spin wave beams, vortex spiral waves, and localized standing waves\nare found to be excited by the interplay of the Oersted field and the\norientation of an applied field. These fields act as a spin wave ``corral''\naround the nanocontact that controls the propagation of spin waves in certain\ndirections.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.77.144401	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	19 pages, 8 figures; added content, figure, and more references
742	0710.2903	Non-LTE dust nucleation in sub-saturated vapors	2007-10-15	2007-11-09	\N	  We use the kinetic theory of nucleation to explore the properties of dust\nnucleation in sub-saturated vapors. Due to radiation losses, the sub-critical\nclusters have a smaller temperature compared to their vapor. This alters the\ndynamical balance between attachment and detachment of monomers, allowing for\nstable nucleation of grains in vapors that are sub-saturated for their\ntemperature. We find this effect particularly important at low densities and in\nthe absence of a strong background radiation field. We find new conditions for\nstable nucleation in the n-T phase diagram. The nucleation in the non-LTE\nregions is likely to be at much slower rate than in the super-saturated vapors.\nWe evaluate the nucleation rate, warning the reader that it does depend on\npoorly substantiated properties of the macro-molecules assumed in the\ncomputation. On the other hand, the conditions for nucleation depend only on\nthe properties of the large stable grains and are more robust. We finally point\nout that this mechanism may be relevant in the early universe as an initial\ndust pollution mechanism, since once the interstellar medium is polluted with\ndust, mantle growth is likely to be dominant over non-LTE nucleation in the\ndiffuse medium.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12678.x	astro-ph cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph	8 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
743	0710.2934	A Tale Of Two Spicules: The Impact of Spicules on the Magnetic\n  Chromosphere	2007-10-16	2007-10-16	\N	  We use high-resolution observations of the Sun in Ca II H 3968 A from the\nSolar Optical Telescope on Hinode to show that there are at least two types of\nspicules that dominate the structure of the magnetic solar chromosphere. Both\ntypes are tied to the relentless magnetoconvective driving in the photosphere,\nbut have very different dynamic properties. ``Type-I'' spicules are driven by\nshock waves that form when global oscillations and convective flows leak into\nthe upper atmosphere along magnetic field lines on 3-7 minute timescales.\n``Type-II'' spicules are much more dynamic: they form rapidly (in ~10s), are\nvery thin (<200km wide), have lifetimes of 10-150s (at any one height) and seem\nto be rapidly heated to (at least) transition region temperatures, sending\nmaterial through the chromosphere at speeds of order 50-150 km/s. The\nproperties of Type II spicules suggest a formation process that is a\nconsequence of magnetic reconnection, typically in the vicinity of magnetic\nflux concentrations in plage and network. Both types of spicules are observed\nto carry Alfven waves with significant amplitudes of order 20 km/s.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S655	astro-ph	8 pages, 5 figures, accepted for Hinode special issue of PASJ

We investigate a paradigm example of cavity quantum electrodynamics with many\nbody systems: an ultracold atomic gas inside a pumped optical resonator. In\nparticular, we study the stability of atomic insulator-like states, confined by\nthe mechanical potential emerging from the cavity field spatial mode structure.\nAs in open space, when the optical potential is sufficiently deep, the atomic\ngas is in the Mott-like state. Inside the cavity, however, the potential\ndepends on the atomic distribution, which determines the refractive index of\nthe medium, thus altering the intracavity field amplitude. We derive the\neffective Bose-Hubbard model describing the physics of the system in one\ndimension and study the crossover between the superfluid -- Mott insulator\nquantum states. We determine the regions of parameters where the atomic\ninsulator states are stable, and predict the existence of overlapping stability\nregions corresponding to competing insulator-like states. Bistable behavior,\ncontrolled by the pump intensity, is encountered in the vicinity of the shifted\ncavity resonance.\n	10.1088/1367-2630/10/4/045002	cond-mat.other quant-ph	13 pages, 6 figures.

We have studied intersubband decay of E22 excitons in semiconducting carbon\nnanotubes experimentally and theoretically. Photoluminescence excitation line\nwidths of semiconducting nanotubes with chiral indicess (n, m) can be mapped\nonto a connectivity grid with curves of constant (n-m) and (2n+m). Moreover,\nthe global behavior of E22 linewidths is best characterized by a strong\nincrease with energy irrespective of their (n-m) mod(3)= \\pm 1 family\naffiliation. Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equations shows that the E22\nlinewidths are dominated by phonon assisted coupling to higher momentum states\nof the E11 and E12 exciton bands. The calculations also suggest that the\nbranching ratio for decay into exciton bands vs free carrier bands,\nrespectively is about 10:1.\n	10.1021/nl0720915	cond-mat.mtrl-sci	4 pages, 4 figures
748	0710.3173	Noise auto-correlation spectroscopy with coherent Raman scattering	2007-10-16	\N	\N	  Ultrafast lasers have become one of the most powerful tools in coherent\nnonlinear optical spectroscopy. Short pulses enable direct observation of fast\nmolecular dynamics, whereas broad spectral bandwidth offers ways of controlling\nnonlinear optical processes by means of quantum interferences. Special care is\nusually taken to preserve the coherence of laser pulses as it determines the\naccuracy of a spectroscopic measurement. Here we present a new approach to\ncoherent Raman spectroscopy based on deliberately introduced noise, which\nincreases the spectral resolution, robustness and efficiency. We probe laser\ninduced molecular vibrations using a broadband laser pulse with intentionally\nrandomized amplitude and phase. The vibrational resonances result in and are\nidentified through the appearance of intensity correlations in the noisy\nspectrum of coherently scattered photons. Spectral resolution is neither\nlimited by the pulse bandwidth, nor sensitive to the quality of the temporal\nand spectral profile of the pulses. This is particularly attractive for the\napplications in microscopy, biological imaging and remote sensing, where\ndispersion and scattering properties of the medium often undermine the\napplicability of ultrafast lasers. The proposed method combines the efficiency\nand resolution of a coherent process with the robustness of incoherent light.\nAs we demonstrate here, it can be implemented by simply destroying the\ncoherence of a laser pulse, and without any elaborate temporal scanning or\nspectral shaping commonly required by the frequency-resolved spectroscopic\nmethods with ultrashort pulses.\n	10.1038/nphys809	physics.chem-ph	To appear in Nature Physics
749	0710.3179	Spectral weight transfer in a disorder-broadened Landau level	2007-10-16	\N	Nature Physics 4, 24 (2008)	  In the absence of disorder, the degeneracy of a Landau level (LL) is\n$N=BA/\\phi_0$, where $B$ is the magnetic field, $A$ is the area of the sample\nand $\\phi_0=h/e$ is the magnetic flux quantum. With disorder, localized states\nappear at the top and bottom of the broadened LL, while states in the center of\nthe LL (the critical region) remain delocalized. This well-known phenomenology\nis sufficient to explain most aspects of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE)\n[1]. One unnoticed issue is where the new states appear as the magnetic field\nis increased. Here we demonstrate that they appear predominantly inside the\ncritical region. This leads to a certain ``spectral ordering'' of the localized\nstates that explains the stripes observed in measurements of the local inverse\ncompressibility [2-3], of two-terminal conductance [4], and of Hall and\nlongitudinal resistances [5] without invoking interactions as done in previous\nwork [6-8].\n	10.1038/nphys786	cond-mat.dis-nn	5 pages 3 figures

The loops correspond to closed trajectories of massive particles\nand we find a phase transition as a function of their mass. We identify the\norder parameter as the average length of the loops at equilibrium. This order\nparameter exhibits a sharp increase as the mass is decreased through a critical\nvalue, the behaviour seems to be a cross-over transition. We believe that the\nmodel represents an effective description of the broken-symmetry sector of the\n2+1 dimensional abelian Higgs model, in the extreme strong coupling limit. The\nmassive gauge bosons and the neutral scalars are decoupled, and the relevant\nlow-lying excitations correspond to vortices and anti-vortices. The functional\nintegral can be approximated by a sum over simple, closed vortex loop\nconfigurations. We present a novel fashion to generate non-intersecting closed\nloops, starting from a tetrahedral tessellation of three space. The two phases\nthat we find admit the following interpretation: the usual Higgs phase and a\nnovel phase which is heralded by the appearance of effectively infinitely long\nloops. We compute the expectation value of the Wilson loop operator and that of\nthe Polyakov loop operator. The Wilson loop exhibits perimeter law behaviour in\nboth phases implying that the transition corresponds neither to the restoration\nof symmetry nor to confinement. The effective interaction between external\ncharges is screened in both phases, however there is a dramatic increase in the\npolarization cloud in the novel phase as shown by the energy shift introduced\nby the Wilson loop.\n	10.1103/PhysRevD.81.114505	hep-lat hep-th	10 pages, 20 figures, color viewing helpful; greatly expanded,\n  published version; title changed
754	0710.3433	Phase behavior and dynamics of a micelle-forming triblock copolymer\n  system	2007-10-18	2008-04-16	Phys. Rev. E vol. 77, 041803 (2008)	  Synperonic F-108 (generic name, 'pluronic') is a micelle forming triblock\ncopolymer of type ABA, where A is polyethylene oxide (PEO) and B is\npolypropylene oxide (PPO). At high temperatures, the hydrophobicity of the PPO\nchains increase, and the pluronic molecules, when dissolved in an aqueous\nmedium, self-associate into spherical micelles with dense PPO cores and\nhydrated PEO coronas. At appropriately high concentrations, these micelles\narrange in a face centred cubic lattice to show inverse crystallization, with\nthe samples exhibiting high-temperature crystalline and low-temperature\nfluidlike phases. By studying the evolution of the elastic and viscous moduli\nas temperature is increased at a fixed rate, we construct the\nconcentration-temperature phase diagram of Synperonic F-108. For a certain\nrange of temperatures and at appropriate sample concentrations, we observe a\npredominantly elastic response. Oscillatory strain amplitude sweep measurements\non these samples show pronounced peaks in the loss moduli, a typical feature of\nsoft solids. The soft solid-like nature of these materials is further\ndemonstrated by measuring their frequency dependent mechanical moduli. The\nstorage moduli are significantly larger than the loss moduli and are almost\nindependent of the applied angular frequency. Finally, we perform strain rate\nfrequency superposition (SRFS) experiments to measure the slow relaxation\ndynamics of this soft solid.\n	10.1103/PhysRevE.77.041803	cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci	17 pages, 6 eps figures

The\ncoupling of the plasmons to interband electron-hole transitions in population\ninverted graphene layers can lead to plasmon amplification through stimulated\nemission. Plasmon gain values in graphene can be very large due to the small\ngroup velocity of the plasmons and the strong confinement of the plasmon field\nin the vicinity of the graphene layer. We present a transmission line model for\nplasmon propagation in graphene that includes plasmon dissipation and plasmon\ninterband gain due to stimulated emission. Using this model, we discuss design\nfor terahertz plasmon oscillators and derive the threshold condition for\noscillation taking into account internal losses and also losses due to external\ncoupling. The large gain values available at terahertz frequencies in graphene\ncan lead to integrated oscillators that have dimensions in the 1-10 micron\nrange.\n	10.1109/TNANO.2007.910334	cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci	To appear in IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology (TNANO)

Unlike usual tree level\ncontributions to meson oscillations from heavy particle exchange with small\n$\\Gamma_{12}$, the unparticle may have sizeable contributions to both $M_{12}$\nand $\\Gamma_{12}$ due to fractional dimension $d_\\U$ of the unparticle. We find\nthat very stringent constraints on the unparticle and particle interactions can\nbe obtained. If unparticle effect dominates the contributions (which may happen\nin $D^0-\\bar D^0$ mixing) to meson mixing parameters $x$ and $y$, we find that\n$x/y =\\cot(\\pi d_\\U)$.

Japan 61, pp.109-122 (2009)	  Spectral studies of quiescent emission and bursts of magnetar candidates\nusing XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift data are presented. Spectra of both the\nquiescent emission and the bursts for most magnetar candidates are reproduced\nby a photoelectrically absorbed two blackbody function (2BB). There is a strong\ncorrelation between lower and higher temperatures of 2BB (kT_LT and kT_HT) for\nthe magnetar candidates of which the spectra are well reproduced by 2BB. In\naddition, a square of radius for kT_T (R_LT^2) is well correlated with a square\nof radius for kT_HT (R_HT^2). A ratio kT_LT/kT_HT ~ 0.4 is nearly constant\nirrespective of objects and/or emission types (i.e., the quiescent emission and\nthe bursts). This would imply a common emission mechanism among the magnetar\ncandidates. The relation between the quiescent emission and the bursts might be\nanalogous to a relation between microflares and solar flares of the sun.

Lett. 99, 237002 (2007)	  Using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we have\nstudied the momentum and photon energy dependence of the anomalous high-energy\ndispersion, termed "waterfalls", between the Fermi level and 1 eV binding\nenergy in several high-Tc superconductors. We observe strong changes of the\ndispersion between different Brillouin zones and a strong dependence on the\nphoton energy around 75 eV, which we associate with the resonant photoemission\nat the Cu 3p3d_{x^2-y^2} edge. We conclude that the high-energy "waterfall"\ndispersion results from a strong suppression of the photoemission intensity at\nthe center of the Brillouin zone due to matrix element effects and is,\ntherefore, not an intrinsic feature of the spectral function. This indicates\nthat the new high energy scale in the electronic structure of cuprates derived\nfrom the "waterfall"-like dispersion may be incorrect.\n	10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.237002	cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el	Accepted to PRL

Phys. 21 (2009) 1-58	  We consider an infinite chain of particles linearly coupled to their nearest\nneighbours and subject to an anharmonic local potential. The chain is assumed\nweakly inhomogeneous. We look for small amplitude discrete breathers. The\nproblem is reformulated as a nonautonomous recurrence in a space of\ntime-periodic functions, where the dynamics is considered along the discrete\nspatial coordinate. We show that small amplitude oscillations are determined by\nfinite-dimensional nonautonomous mappings, whose dimension depends on the\nsolutions frequency. We consider the case of two-dimensional reduced mappings,\nwhich occurs for frequencies close to the edges of the phonon band. For an\nhomogeneous chain, the reduced map is autonomous and reversible, and\nbifurcations of reversible homoclinics or heteroclinic solutions are found for\nappropriate parameter values. These orbits correspond respectively to discrete\nbreathers, or dark breathers superposed on a spatially extended standing wave.\nBreather existence is shown in some cases for any value of the coupling\nconstant, which generalizes an existence result obtained by MacKay and Aubry at\nsmall coupling. For an inhomogeneous chain the study of the nonautonomous\nreduced map is in general far more involved. For the principal part of the\nreduced recurrence, using the assumption of weak inhomogeneity, we show that\nhomoclinics to 0 exist when the image of the unstable manifold under a linear\ntransformation intersects the stable manifold. This provides a geometrical\nunderstanding of tangent bifurcations of discrete breathers. The case of a mass\nimpurity is studied in detail, and our geometrical analysis is successfully\ncompared with direct numerical simulations.\n	\N	nlin.PS	\N
769	0710.4196	Magnitude Uncertainties Impact Seismic Rate Estimates, Forecasts and\n  Predictability Experiments	2007-10-23	\N	\N	  The Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) aims to\nprospectively test time-dependent earthquake probability forecasts on their\nconsistency with observations. To compete, time-dependent seismicity models are\ncalibrated on earthquake catalog data. But catalogs contain much observational\nuncertainty. We study the impact of magnitude uncertainties on rate estimates\nin clustering models, on their forecasts and on their evaluation by CSEP's\nconsistency tests. First, we quantify magnitude uncertainties. We find that\nmagnitude uncertainty is more heavy-tailed than a Gaussian, such as a\ndouble-sided exponential distribution, with scale parameter nu_c=0.1 - 0.3.\nSecond, we study the impact of such noise on the forecasts of a simple\nclustering model which captures the main ingredients of popular short term\nmodels. We prove that the deviations of noisy forecasts from an exact forecast\nare power law distributed in the tail with exponent alpha=1/(a*nu_c), where a\nis the exponent of the productivity law of aftershocks. We further prove that\nthe typical scale of the fluctuations remains sensitively dependent on the\nspecific catalog. Third, we study how noisy forecasts are evaluated in CSEP\nconsistency tests. Noisy forecasts are rejected more frequently than expected\nfor a given confidence limit. The Poisson assumption of the consistency tests\nis inadequate for short-term forecast evaluations. To capture the\nidiosyncrasies of each model together with any propagating uncertainties, the\nforecasts need to specify the entire likelihood distribution of seismic rates.\n	10.1029/2007JB005427	physics.geo-ph	35 pages, including 15 figures, agu style

Phys. 104, 014307 (2008)	  Combining the recent progress in semiconductor nanostructures along with the\nversatility of photonic crystals in confining and manipulating light, quantum\nnetworks allow for the prospect of an integrated and low power quantum\ntechnology. Within quantum networks, which consist of a system of waveguides\nand nanocavities with embedded quantum dots, it has been demonstrated in theory\nthat many-qubit states stored in electron spins could be teleported from one\nquantum dot to another via a single photon using the Single Photon Faraday\nEffect. However, in addition to being able to transfer quantum information from\none location to another, quantum networks need added functionality such as (1)\ncontrolling the flow of the quantum information and (2) performing specific\noperations on qubits that can be easily integrated. In this paper, we show how\nin principle a single photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which uses the\nconcept of the single photon Faraday Effect to manipulate the geometrical phase\nof a single photon, can be operated both as a switch to control the flow of\nquantum information inside the quantum network and as various single qubit\nquantum gates to perform operations on a single photon. Our proposed\nMach-Zehnder interferometer can be fully integrated as part of a quantum\nnetwork on a chip. Given that the X gate, the Z gate, and the XZ gate are\nessential for the implementation of quantum teleportation, we show explicitly\ntheir implementation by means of our proposed single photon Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer. We also show explicitly the implementation of the Hadamard gate\nand the single-qubit phase gate, which are needed to complete the universal set\nof quantum gates for integrated quantum computing in a quantum network.\n	10.1063/1.2948924	cond-mat.mes-hall	25 pages, 16 figures

The low-energy S-wave pi N and K N scatterings are studied by the K-matrix\napproach within the meson exchange framework. The t-channel meson exchanges,\nespecially rho and sigma exchanges, are found to play a very important role in\nthese two processes. The t-channel rho exchange determines the isospin\nstructure of the scattering amplitudes, it gives attractive force in the low\nisospin state but repulsive force in the high isospin state. The t-channel\nsigma exchange gives a very large contribution in these two processes, while it\nis negligible in meson-meson S-wave scatterings.\n	10.1088/1674-1137/32/8/008	hep-ph	11 pages, 3 figures
776	0710.4526	Geoeffectiveness of halo CMEs	2007-10-24	\N	SpaceWeatherJ.4:S10003,2006	  Halo coronal mass ejections (HCMEs) originating from regions close to the\ncenter of the Sun are likely to be geoeffective. Assuming that the shape of\nHCMEs is a cone and they propagate with constant angular widths and velocities,\nat least in their early phase, we have developed a technique (Michalek et al.\n2003) which allowed us to obtain the space speed, width and source location. We\napply this technique to obtain the parameters of all full HCMEs observed by the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission's Large Angle and\nSpectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) experiment until the end of 2002. Using this\ndata we examine which parameters determine the geoeffectiveness of HCMEs. We\nshow that in the considered period of time only fast halo CMEs (with the space\nvelocities higher than $\\sim 1000{km\\over s}$ and originating from the western\nhemisphere close to the solar center could cause the severe geomagnetic storms.\nWe illustrate how the HCME parameters can be used for space weather forecast.\nIt is also demonstrated that the strength of a geomagnetic storm does not\ndepend on the determined width of HCMEs. This means that HCMEs do not have to\nbe very large to cause major geomagnetic storms.\n	10.1002/2005SW000218	astro-ph	\N

778	0710.4587	Spin-orbit induced interference in quantum corrals	2007-10-24	\N	\N	  Lack of inversion symmetry at a metallic surface can lead to an observable\nspin-orbit interaction. For certain metal surfaces, such as the Au(111)\nsurface, the experimentally observed spin-orbit coupling results in spin\nrotation lengths on the order of tens of nanometers, which is the typical\nlength scale associated with quantum corral structures formed on metal\nsurfaces. In this work, multiple scattering theory is used to calculate the\nlocal density of states (LDOS) of quantum corral structures comprised of\nnonmagnetic adatoms in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Contrary to\nprevious theoretical predictions, spin-orbit coupling induced modulations are\nobserved in the theoretical LDOS, which should be observable using scanning\ntunneling microscopy.\n	10.1021/nl071711z	cond-mat.mes-hall	7 pages, 3 figures, accepted to Nano Letters

Abundance analysis confirms\nprevious results showing that V CrA has the composition of the small subclass\nof R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars know as `minority' RCBs, i.e., the Si/Fe and\nS/Fe ratios are 100 times their solar values.\n  A notable novel result for RCBs is the detection of the 1-0 Swan system\n$^{12}$C$^{13}$C bandhead indicating that $^{13}$C is abundant: spectrum\nsynthesis shows that $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C is about 3 to 4.

782	0710.5087	Spitzer IRS mapping of the central kpc of Centaurus A	2007-10-26	\N	2008, MNRAS, 384, 1469	  We report on the results of infrared spectroscopic mapping observations\ncarried out in the nuclear region of Centaurus A (NGC5128). The 500 pc bipolar\ndust shell discovered by Quillen et al.(2006) is even more clearly seen in the\n11.3 micron dust emission feature than previous broad band imaging. The pure\nrotational lines of molecular hydrogen other than the S(0) line are detected\nabove the dusty disk and associated with the oval dust shell. The molecular\nhydrogen transitions indicate the presence of warm gas at temperatures\n250--720K. The ratio of the dust emission features at 7.7 and 11.3 micron and\nthe ratio of the [NeII](12.8) and 11.3 dust emission feature are lower in the\n500 pc dust shell than in the star forming disk. The clearer shell morphology\nat 11.3 micron, warm molecular hydrogen emission in the shell, and variation in\nline ratios in the shell compared to those in the disk, confirm\nspectroscopically that this shell is a separate coherent entity and is unlikely\nto be a chance superposition of dust filaments. The physical conditions in the\nshell are most similar to Galactic supernova remnants where blast waves\nencounter molecular clouds. The lines requiring the highest level of\nionization, [NeV] and [OIV], are detected 20--25 arcsec north-east and\nsouth-west of the nucleus and at position angles near the radio jet axis. Fine\nstructure line ratios and limits from this region suggest that the medium is\nlow density and illuminated by a hard radiation field at low ionization\nparameter. These higher S molecular hydrogen pure rotational transitions are\nalso particularly bright in the same region as the [OIV] and [NeV] emission.\nThis suggests that the gas associated with the dust shell has been excited near\nthe jet axis and is part of an ionization cone.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12768.x	astro-ph	submitted to MNRAS
783	0710.5093	High Energy spectra of Seyferts and Unification schemes	2007-10-26	\N	\N	  The Unified Model of AGN predicts the sole difference between Seyfert 1 and\nSeyfert 2 nuclei is the viewing angle with respect to an obscuring structure\naround the nucleus. High energy photons above 20 keV are not affected by this\nabsorption if the column is Compton thin, so their 30--100 keV spectra should\nbe the same. However, the observed spectra at high energies appear to show a\nsystematic difference, with Seyfert 1's having $\\Gamma \\sim $2.1 whereas\nSeyfert 2's are harder with $\\Gamma \\sim$ 1.9. We estimate the mass and\naccretion rate of Seyferts detected in these high energy samples and show that\nthey span a wide range in $L/L_{Edd}$. Both black hole binary systems and AGN\nshow a correlation between spectral softness and Eddington fraction, so these\nsamples are probably heterogeneous, spanning a range of intrinsic spectral\nindices which are hidden in individual objects by poor signal-to-noise.\nHowever, the mean Eddington fraction for the Seyfert 1's is higher than for the\nSeyfert 2's, so the samples are consistent with this being the origin of the\nsofter spectra seen in Seyfert 1's. We stress that high energy spectra alone\nare not necessarily a clean test of Unification schemes, but that the intrinsic\nnuclear properties should also change with $L/L_{Edd}$\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12648.x	astro-ph	6 pages,1 figure, 2 tables

The intrinsic ellipticity of\n  bulges	2007-10-29	2007-11-22	\N	  (Abridged) A variety of formation scenarios was proposed to explain the\ndiversity of properties observed in bulges. Studying their intrinsic shape can\nhelp in constraining the dominant mechanism at the epochs of their assembly.\nThe structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148 unbarred S0--Sb\ngalaxies were derived in order to study the correlations between bulges and\ndisks as well as the probability distribution function (PDF) of the intrinsic\nequatorial ellipticity of bulges. It is presented a new fitting algorithm\n(GASP2D) to perform the two-dimensional photometric decomposition of galaxy\nsurface-brightness distribution. This was assumed to be the sum of the\ncontribution of a bulge and disk component characterized by elliptical and\nconcentric isophotes with constant (but possibly different) ellipticity and\nposition angles. Bulge and disk parameters of the sample galaxies were derived\nfrom the J-band images which were available in the Two Micron All Sky Survey.\nThe PDF of the equatorial ellipticity of the bulges was derived from the\ndistribution of the observed ellipticities of bulges and misalignments between\nbulges and disks. Strong correlations between the bulge and disk parameters\nwere found. About 80% of bulges in unbarred lenticular and\nearly-to-intermediate spiral galaxies are not oblate but triaxial ellipsoids.\nTheir mean axial ratio in the equatorial plane is <B/A> = 0.85. There is not\nsignificant dependence of their PDF on morphology, light concentration, and\nluminosity. The interplay between bulge and disk parameters favors scenarios in\nwhich bulges assembled from mergers and/or grew over long times through disk\nsecular evolution. But all these mechanisms have to be tested against the\nderived distribution of bulge intrinsic ellipticities.\n	10.1051/0004-6361:20078089e	astro-ph	24 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A, corrected\n  proofs

The present paper is a study on what can be\nachieved for infinite transition systems under these premises. As models we\nconsider products of infinite transition systems with different synchronization\nconstraints. We introduce finitely synchronized transition systems, i.e.\nproduct systems which contain only finitely many (parameterized) synchronized\ntransitions, and show that the decidability of FO(R), first-order logic\nextended by reachability predicates, of the product system can be reduced to\nthe decidability of FO(R) of the components. This result is optimal in the\nfollowing sense: (1) If we allow semifinite synchronization, i.e. just in one\ncomponent infinitely many transitions are synchronized, the FO(R)-theory of the\nproduct system is in general undecidable. (2) We cannot extend the expressive\npower of the logic under consideration. Already a weak extension of first-order\nlogic with transitive closure, where we restrict the transitive closure\noperators to arity one and nesting depth two, is undecidable for an\nasynchronous (and hence finitely synchronized) product, namely for the infinite\ngrid.\n	10.2168/LMCS-3(4:5)2007	cs.LO	18 pages

We also calculate\nthe k/f values for each cavity, where k is the ratio of the total particle\nenergy to that of electrons radiating in the range of 10 MHz to 10 GHz, and f\nis the volume filling factor of the plasma in the cavity. We find that the\nvalues of k/f for the lobes of NGC 1399 are ~93 and ~190, and those of the\nlobes of NGC 4649 are ~15000 and ~12000. We conclude that the assumed spectrum\ndescribes the electron distribution in the lobes of NGC 1399 reasonably well,\nand that there are few entrained particles. For NGC 4649, either there are many\nentrained particles or the model spectrum does not accurately describe the\npopulation of electrons.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12651.x	astro-ph	8 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS

This result was proved by Chemin & Lerner (J\nDiff Eq 121 (1995) 314-328) using the Littlewood-Paley theory for the flow in\nthe whole space $\\R^d$, $d\\ge 2$. We first show that the solutions of the\ndifferential equation $\\dot{X}=u(X,t)$ are unique if $u\\in\nL^p(0,T;H^{(d/2)-1})$ for some $p>1$ and $\\sqrt{t}\\,u\\in L^2(0,T;H^{(d/2)+1})$.\nWe then prove, using standard energy methods, that the solution of the\nNavier-Stokes equations with initial condition in $H^{(d/2)-1}$ satisfies these\nconditions. This proof is also valid for the more physically relevant case of\nbounded domains.\n	10.1088/0951-7715/22/4/003	math.AP	13 pages, 0 figures

794	0710.5743	The Einstein-Boltzmann Relation for Thermodynamic and Hydrodynamic\n  Fluctuations	2007-10-30	2007-11-19	J. Non-Equilib.Thermodyn. 32, 29-40 (2007)	  When making the connection between the thermodynamics of irreversible\nprocesses and the theory of stochastic processes through the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem, it is necessary to invoke a postulate of the\nEinstein-Boltzmann type. For convective processes hydrodynamic fluctuations\nmust be included, the velocity is a dynamical variable and although the entropy\ncannot depend directly on the velocity, $\\delta^{2} S$ will depend on velocity\nvariations. Some authors do not include velocity variations in $\\delta^{2} S$,\nand so have to introduce a non-thermodynamic function which replaces the\nentropy and does depend on the velocity. At first sight, it seems that the\nintroduction of such a function requires a generalisation of the\nEinstein-Boltzmann relation to be invoked. We review the reason why it is not\nnecessary to introduce such a function, and therefore why there is no need to\ngeneralise the Einstein-Boltzmann relation in this way. We then obtain the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem which shows some differences as compared with\nthe non-convective case. We also show that $\\delta^{2} S$ is a Liapunov\nfunction when it includes velocity fluctuations.\n	10.1515/JNETDY.2007.002	cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.mes-hall	13 Pages

Moreover, It\nintroduces how the renormalization group approach can be implemented to obtain\nthe quantum information properties of a many body system.

However, the above-mentioned effects can be calculated\nwithout integrating the geodesic equations if one is able to determine the\nbifunction $\\Omega(x_A, x_B)$ giving half the squared geodesic distance between\ntwo points $x_A$ and $x_B$ (this bifunction may be called Synge's world\nfunction). In this lecture, $\\Omega(x_A, x_B)$ is determined up to the order\n$1/c^3$ within the framework of the PPN formalism. The case of a stationary\ngravitational field generated by an isolated, slowly rotating axisymmetric body\nis studied in detail. The calculation of the time delay and the frequency shift\nis carried out up to the order $1/c^4$. Explicit formulae are obtained for the\ncontributions of the mass, of the quadrupole moment and of the internal angular\nmomentum when the only post-Newtonian parameters different from zero are\n$\\beta$ and $\\gamma$. It is shown that the frequency shift induced by the mass\nquadrupole moment of the Earth at the order $1/c^3$ will amount to $10^{-16}$\nin spatial experiments like the ESA's Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space mission.\nOther contributions are briefly discussed.\n	10.1007/978-3-540-34377-6_6	gr-qc	18 pages, To appear in: "Lasers, Clocks and Drag-Free control:\n  Exploration of Relativistic Gravity in Space", Springer Series on\n  Astrophysics and Space Science Library, vol 349, p 153

This was long thought to be impossible, but our position\neigenvectors have a vortex structure like twisted light. Thus they are not\nspherically symmetric and the position operator does not transform as a vector,\nso that previous non-existence arguments do not apply. We find two classes of\nposition eigenvectors and obtain photon wave functions by projection onto the\nbases of position eigenkets that they define, following the usual rules of\nquantum mechanics. The hermitian position operator, r0, leads to a\nLandau-Peierls wave function, while field-like eigenvectors of the nonhermitian\nposition operator and its adjoint lead to a biorthonormal basis. These two\nbases are equivalent in the sense that they are related by a similarity\ntransformation. The eigenvectors of the nonhermitian position operators lead to\na field-potential wave function pair. These field-like positive frequency wave\nfunctions satisfy Maxwell's equations, and thus justify the supposition that\nMEs describe single photon wave mechanics. The expectation value of the number\noperator is photon density with undetected photons integrated over, consistent\nwith Feynman's conclusion that the density of non-interacting particles can be\ninterpreted as probability density.\n	10.1117/12.730703	quant-ph	Comments to margaret.hawton@lakehead.ca will be appreciated

This model can be solved in the\nmicrocanonical ensemble. It is shown that in certain parameter regions the\nmodel exhibits gaps in the magnetization at fixed energy, resulting in\nergodicity breaking. This phenomenon has previously been reported in\nanisotropic and discrete spin models. The entropy of the model is calculated\nand the microcanonical phase diagram is derived, showing the existence of first\norder phase transitions from the ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic disordered\nphase. It is found that ergodicity breaking takes place both in the\nferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phases. As a consequence, the system can\nexhibit a stable ferromagnetic phase within the paramagnetic region, and\nconversely a disordered phase within the magnetically ordered region.\n	10.1103/PhysRevE.77.011125	cond-mat.stat-mech	\N

The influence of\nplasma dynamics on the saturation process of the CDI is studied. On the basis\nof the Euler, continuity, and induction equations, we derive the increment of\nthe CDI and analyze parametrically excited drift modes. The dynamics of the\nreconstruction of the pulsar magnetosphere is studied analytically. We show\nthat there is a possibility of a parametrically excited rotational-energy\npumping-process in the drift modes. It is indicated by the generation of a\ntoroidal component of the magnetic field that transforms the field lines into\nsuch a configuration, in which plasma particles do not experience any forces.\nAt this stage, the instability process saturates and the further amplification\nof the toroidal component to the magnetic field lines is suspended.\n	10.1051/0004-6361/200912113	astro-ph	6 pages, 5 figures

810	0711.0357	Observations of Transient Active Region Heating with Hinode	2007-11-02	\N	\N	  We present observations of transient active region heating events observed\nwith the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and X-ray Telescope\n(XRT) on Hinode. This initial investigation focuses on NOAA active region 10940\nas observed by Hinode on February 1, 2007 between 12 and 19 UT. In these\nobservations we find numerous examples of transient heating events within the\nactive region. The high spatial resolution and broad temperature coverage of\nthese instruments allows us to track the evolution of coronal plasma. The\nevolution of the emission observed with XRT and EIS during these events is\ngenerally consistent with loops that have been heated and are cooling. We have\nanalyzed the most energetic heating event observed during this period, a small\nGOES B-class flare, in some detail and present some of the spectral signatures\nof the event, such as relative Doppler shifts at one of the loop footpoints and\nenhanced line widths during the rise phase of the event. While the analysis of\nthese transient events has the potential to yield insights into the coronal\nheating mechanism, these observations do not rule out the possibility that\nthere is a strong steady heating level in the active region. Detailed\nstatistical analysis will be required to address this question definitively.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S675	astro-ph	\N

Emergent intensity\nis analytically obtained in the cases with or without internal heating. For\nlarge or infinite optical depth, the emergent intensity exhibits a usual\nlimb-darkening effect, where the intensity linearly changes as a function of\nthe direction cosine. For small optical depth, on the other hand, the\nangle-dependence of the emergent intensity drastically changes. In the case\nwithout heating but with uniform incident radiation at the disk equator, the\nemergent intensity becomes isotropic for small optical depth. In the case with\nuniform internal heating, the limb brightening takes place for small optical\ndepth.

Using a velocity-dependent variable\nEddington factor, we can solve the rigorous equations of the relativistic\nradiative flow accelerated up to the {\\it relativistic} speed.

815	0711.0424	Radiative Transfer in Accretion-Disk Winds	2007-11-03	\N	Publ.Astron.Soc.Jap.59:687,2007	  Radiative transfer equation in an accretion disk wind is examined\nanalytically and numerically under the plane-parallel approximation in the\nsubrelativistic regime of $(v/c)^1$, where $v$ is the wind vertical velocity.\nEmergent intensity is analytically obtained for the case of a large optical\ndepth, where the flow speed and the source function are almost constant. The\nusual limb-darkening effect, which depends on the direction cosine at the\nzero-optical depth surface, does not appear, since the source function is\nconstant. Because of the vertical motion of winds, however, the emergent\nintensity exhibits the {\\it velocity-dependent} limb-darkening effect, which\ncomes from the Doppler and aberration effects. Radiative moments and emergent\nintensity are also numerically obtained. When the flow speed is small ($v \\leq\n0.1c$), the radiative structure resembles to that of the static atmosphere,\nwhere the source function is proportional to the optical depth, and the usual\nlimb-darkening effect exists. When the flow speed becomes large, on the other\nhand, the flow speed attains the constant terminal one, and the\nvelocity-dependent limb-darkening effect appears. We thus carefully treat and\nestimate the wind luminosity and limb-darkening effect, when we observe an\naccretion disk wind.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.3.687	astro-ph	8 pages, 5 figures

PAHs are not likely to form by gas-phase or solid-state\ninterstellar chemistry, but rather might be produced in the outflows of\ncarbon-rich evolved stars. PAHs could form from acetylene addition to the\nphenyl radical (C6H5), which is closely chemically related to benzene (C6H6)\nand ortho-benzyne (o-C6H4). To date, circumstellar chemical models have been\nlimited to only a partial treatment of benzene-related chemistry, and so the\nexpected abundances of these species are unclear. A detection of benzene has\nbeen reported in the envelope of the proto-planetary nebula (PPN) CRL 618, but\nno other benzene-related species has been detected in this or any other source.\nThe spectrum of o-C6H4 is significantly simpler and stronger than that of C6H5,\nand so we conducted deep Ku-, K- and Q-band searches for o-C6H4 with the Green\nBank Telescope. No transitions were detected, but an upper limit on the column\ndensity of 8.4x10^13 cm^-2 has been determined. This limit can be used to\nconstrain chemical models of PPNe, and this study illustrates the need for\ncomplete revision of these models to include the full set of benzene-related\nchemistry.\n	10.1086/525042	astro-ph	13 pages, 4 figures, to be published in The Astrophysical Journal\n  Letters

Phys., Vol. 253, pp. 189-208, 2013	  In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate numerical method for\ncomputing the ground state of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) by using\nthe normalized gradient flow or imaginary time method. The key idea is to find\na third projection or normalization condition based on the relation between the\nchemical potentials so that the three projection parameters used in the\nprojection step of the normalized gradient flow are uniquely determined by this\ncondition as well as the other two physical conditions given by the\nconservation of total mass and total magnetization. This allows us to\nsuccessfully extend the most popular and powerful normalized gradient flow or\nimaginary time method for computing the ground state of single component BEC to\ncompute the ground state of spin-1 BEC. An efficient and accurate\ndiscretization scheme, the backward-forward Euler sine-pseudospectral method\n(BFSP), is proposed to discretize the normalized gradient flow.

Phys. 131 (2008) 631-650	  We present the number of dimers $N_d(n)$ on the Sierpinski gasket $SG_d(n)$\nat stage $n$ with dimension $d$ equal to two, three, four or five, where one of\nthe outmost vertices is not covered when the number of vertices $v(n)$ is an\nodd number. The entropy of absorption of diatomic molecules per site, defined\nas $S_{SG_d}=\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln N_d(n)/v(n)$, is calculated to be\n$\\ln(2)/3$ exactly for $SG_2(n)$. The numbers of dimers on the generalized\nSierpinski gasket $SG_{d,b}(n)$ with $d=2$ and $b=3,4,5$ are also obtained\nexactly. Their entropies are equal to $\\ln(6)/7$, $\\ln(28)/12$, $\\ln(200)/18$,\nrespectively. The upper and lower bounds for the entropy are derived in terms\nof the results at a certain stage for $SG_d(n)$ with $d=3,4,5$. As the\ndifference between these bounds converges quickly to zero as the calculated\nstage increases, the numerical value of $S_{SG_d}$ with $d=3,4,5$ can be\nevaluated with more than a hundred significant figures accurate.\n	10.1007/s10955-008-9516-0	cond-mat.stat-mech	35 pages, 20 figures and 1 table

HST UV imaging of a few Seyfert 2 galaxies\nhave resolved nuclear starbursts in Seyfert 2 revealing stellar clusters as the\nmain building blocks of the extended emission. However, we do not know whether\nstellar clusters are always associated with all types of nuclear activity. We\npresent NUV and optical images provided by HST to find out the role that\nstellar clusters play in different types of AGNs (Seyferts and LLAGNs). Also\nwith these images, we study the circumnuclear dust morphology as a probe of the\ncircumnuclear environment of AGNs. Here we present a summary of the the first\nresults obtained for the sample of Seyferts and LLAGN galaxies.\n	10.1007/s10509-008-9834-3	astro-ph	Contribution to the conference proceedings "Space Astronomy: The UV\n  window to the Universe", El Escorial (Spain), May 28-June 1 2007, submitted\n  to Ap&SS, invited ed.

822	0711.0694	Performance Bounds for Lambda Policy Iteration and Application to the\n  Game of Tetris	2007-11-05	2011-10-11	\N	  We consider the discrete-time infinite-horizon optimal control problem\nformalized by Markov Decision Processes. We revisit the work of Bertsekas and\nIoffe, that introduced $\\lambda$ Policy Iteration, a family of algorithms\nparameterized by $\\lambda$ that generalizes the standard algorithms Value\nIteration and Policy Iteration, and has some deep connections with the Temporal\nDifferences algorithm TD($\\lambda$) described by Sutton and Barto. We deepen\nthe original theory developped by the authors by providing convergence rate\nbounds which generalize standard bounds for Value Iteration described for\ninstance by Puterman. Then, the main contribution of this paper is to develop\nthe theory of this algorithm when it is used in an approximate form and show\nthat this is sound. Doing so, we extend and unify the separate analyses\ndevelopped by Munos for Approximate Value Iteration and Approximate Policy\nIteration. Eventually, we revisit the use of this algorithm in the training of\na Tetris playing controller as originally done by Bertsekas and Ioffe. We\nprovide an original performance bound that can be applied to such an\nundiscounted control problem. Our empirical results are different from those of\nBertsekas and Ioffe (which were originally qualified as "paradoxical" and\n"intriguing"), and much more conform to what one would expect from a learning\nexperiment. We discuss the possible reason for such a difference.\n	\N	cs.AI cs.RO	No. RR-6348 (2011)

824	0711.0848	Bose-Einstein condensation and gauge symmetry breaking	2007-11-06	\N	Laser Phys. Lett. 4 (2007) 632-647	  The fundamental problem is analized, the relation between Bose-Einstein\ncondensation and spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. This relation is largerly\nmisunderstood in physics community. Numerous articles and books contain the\nstatement that, though gauge symmetry breaking helps for describing\nBose-Einstein condensation, but the latter, in principle, does not require any\nsymmetry breaking. This, however, is not correct. The analysis is based on the\nknown mathematical theorems. But in order not to overcomplicate the\npresentation and to make it accessible to all readers, technical details are\noften omitted here. The emphasis is made on the following basic general facts:\nSpontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry is the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for Bose-Einstein condensation. Condensate fluctuations, in\nthermodynamic limit, are negligible. Their catastrophic behavior can arise only\nas a result of incorrect calculations, when a Bose-condensed system is\ndescribed without gauge symmetry breaking. It is crucially important to employ\nthe representative statistical ensembles equipped with all conditions that are\nnecessary for a unique and mathematically correct description of the given\nstatistical system. Only then one is able to develop a self-consistent theory,\nfree of paradoxes.\n	10.1002/lapl.200710029	cond-mat.stat-mech	Latex file, 29 pages

D. 53, 217 (2009)	  We develop an information theoretic interpretation of the number-phase\ncomplementarity in atomic systems, where phase is treated as a continuous\npositive operator valued measure (POVM). The relevant uncertainty principle is\nobtained as an upper bound on a sum of knowledge of these two observables for\nthe case of two-level systems. A tighter bound characterizing the uncertainty\nrelation is obtained numerically in terms of a weighted knowledge sum involving\nthese variables. We point out that complementarity in these systems departs\nfrom mutual unbiasededness in two signalificant ways: first, the maximum\nknowledge of a POVM variable is less than log(dimension) bits; second,\nsurprisingly, for higher dimensional systems, the unbiasedness may not be\nmutual but unidirectional in that phase remains unbiased with respect to number\nstates, but not vice versa. Finally, we study the effect of non-dissipative and\ndissipative noise on these complementary variables for a single-qubit system.\n	10.1140/epjd/e2009-00049-1	quant-ph	16 pages

This can be used to simulate or predict results for different Bell's\ninequalities tests, with distinct configurations and larger number of qubits.\nTo demonstrate our scheme, we implemented a simulation of the violation of\nClauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality using a two qubit NMR system\nand compared the results to those of a photon experiment. The experimental\nresults are well described by Quantum Mechanics theory and a Local Realistic\nHidden Variables model which was specially developed for NMR. That is why we\nrefer to this experiment as a {\\it simulation} of the Bell's inequality\nviolation. Our result shows explicitly how both theories can be compatible to\neach other due the detection loophole. In the last part of this work we discuss\nthe possibility of testing fundamental features of quantum mechanics using NMR\nwith highly polarized spins, where a strong discrepancy between quantum\nmechanics and hidden variables models can be expected.\n	10.1088/1367-2630/10/3/033020	quant-ph	Submited to New Journal of Physics
826	0711.0877	Defects in correlated metals and superconductors	2007-11-06	\N	Rev. Mod. Phys. 81, 45 (2009)	  In materials with strong local Coulomb interactions, simple defects such as\natomic substitutions strongly affect both macroscopic and local properties of\nthe system. A nonmagnetic impurity, for instance, is seen to induce magnetism\nnearby. Even without disorder, models of such correlated systems are generally\nnot soluble in 2 or 3 dimensions, and so few exact results are known for the\nproperties of such impurities. Nevertheless, some simple physical ideas have\nemerged from experiments and approximate theories. Here, we first review what\nwe can learn about this problem from 1D antiferromagnetically correlated\nsystems. We then discuss experiments on the high Tc cuprate normal state which\nprobe the effect of impurities on local charge and spin degrees of freedom, and\ncompare with theories of single impurities in correlated hosts, as well as\nphenomenological effective Kondo descriptions. Subsequently, we review theories\nof impurities in d-wave superconductors including residual quasiparticle\ninteractions, and compare with experiments in the superconducting state. We\nargue that existing data exhibit a remarkable similarity to impurity-induced\nmagnetism in the 1D case, implying the importance of electronic correlations\nfor the understanding of these phenomena, and suggesting that impurities may\nprovide excellent probes of the still poorly understood ground state of the\ncuprates.\n	10.1103/RevModPhys.81.45	cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con	66 pages, 48 figures, review article

829	0711.1019	Discovery of Polarization Reverberation in NGC 4151	2007-11-07	2012-02-24	\N	  Observations of the optical polarization of NGC 4151 in 1997-2003 show\nvariations of an order of magnitude in the polarized flux while the\npolarization position angle remains constant. The amplitude of variability of\nthe polarized flux is comparable to the amplitude of variability of the total\nU-band flux, except that the polarized flux follows the total flux with a lag\nof 8 +/- 3 days. The time lag and the constancy of the position angle strongly\nfavor a scattering origin for the variable polarization rather than a\nnon-thermal synchrotron origin. The orientation of the position angle of the\npolarized flux (parallel to the radio axis) and the size of the lag imply that\nthe polarization arises from electron scattering in a flattened region within\nthe low-ionization component of the broad-line-region. Polarization from dust\nscattering in the equatorial torus is ruled out as the source of the lag in\npolarized flux because it would produce a larger lag and, unless the\nhalf-opening angle of the torus is more than 53 degrees, the polarization would\nbe perpendicular to the radio axis. We note a long-term change in the\npercentage of polarization at similar total flux levels and this could be due\neither to changing non-axisymmetry in the optical continuum emission, or a\nchange in the number of scatterers on a timescale of years.\n	10.1088/0004-637X/749/2/148	astro-ph	5 pages, 2 figures.

830	0711.1120	Electroexcitation of the Roper resonance from CLAS data	2007-11-07	\N	\N	  The helicity amplitudes of the electroexcitation of the Roper resonance on\nproton are extracted at 1.7 < Q2 < 4.2 GeV2 from recent high precision\nJLab-CLAS cross sections data and longitudinally polarized beam asymmetry for\npi+ electroproduction on protons. The analysis is made using two approaches,\ndispersion relations and unitary isobar model, which give consistent results.\nIt is found that the transverse helicity amplitude for the gamma* p -->\nP11(1440) transition, which is large and negative at Q2=0, becomes large and\npositive at Q2 ~ 2 GeV2, and then drops slowly with Q2. Longitudinal helicity\namplitude, that was previously found from CLAS data as large and positive at\nQ2=0.4,0.65 GeV2, drops with Q2. These results rule out the presentation of\nP11(1440) as a 3qG hybrid state, and provide strong evidence in favor of this\nresonance as a first radial excitation of the 3q ground state.\n	10.1007/978-3-540-85144-8_51	nucl-th	3 pages, 2 figures, Talk on the Workshop on "The Physics of Excited\n  Nucleons", Bonn, Germany, October 2007

Neutron scattering studies and measurements of the dielectric susceptibility\nand ferroelectric polarization P have been carried out in various magnetic\nfields H for single-crystal samples of the multiferroic system LiVCuO4 with\nquasi one-dimensional spin 1/2 Cu2+ chains formed of edge-sharing CuO4 square\nplanes, and the relationship between the magnetic structure and\nferroelectricity has been studied. The ferroelectric polarization is\nsignificantly suppressed by the magnetic field H above 2 T applied along a and\nb axes. The helical magnetic structure with the helical axis parallel to c has\nbeen confirmed in H=0, and for H//a, the spin flop transition takes place at\nH=2 T with increasing H, where the helical axis changes to the direction\nparallel to H. The ferroelectric polarization along a at H=0 is found to be\nproportional to the neutron magnetic scattering intensity, indicating that the\nmagnetic order is closely related to the appearance of the ferroelectricity.\nThe relationship between the magnetic structure and ferroelectricity of LiVCuO4\nis discussed by considering the existing theories.\n	10.1143/JPSJ.77.023712	cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mtrl-sci	4 pages (5 figures), submitted to J.

The model is solved\nanalytically by means of a field-theoretical effective-medium theory\n(self-consistent Born approximation) and numerically on a square lattice. As in\nthe uncorrelated case the theory predicts an enhancement of the density of\nstates over Debye's $\\omega^{d-1}$ law (``boson peak'') as a result of\ndisorder. This anomay becomes reinforced for increasing correlation length\n$\\xi$. The theory predicts that $\\xi$ times the width of the Brillouin line\nshould be a universal function of $\\xi$ times the wavenumber. Such a scaling is\nfound in the 2d simulation data, so that they can be represented in a universal\nplot. In the low-wavenumber regime, where the lattice structure is irrelevant\nthere is excellent agreement between the simulation at small disorder. At\nlarger disorder the continuum theory deviates from the lattice simulation data.\nIt is argued that this is due to an instability of the model with stronger\ndisorder.\n	10.1002/pssc.200777584	cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.other	5 pages, 3 figures, to be published in physica status solidi (c)\n  March 2008

We found that there are two water maser clusters (WMC1 and WMC2)\nseparated from each other by 1".6 (2900 AU at a distance of 1.8 kpc). The\nproper motion measurement reveals that WMC1 is associated with a bipolar\noutflow elongated in the east-west direction with an expansion velocity of\n69+-11 km/s. WMC1 and WMC2 are associated with two 345 GHz continuum dust\nemission sources, and located 2" (3600 AU) east from the core of an\nultracompact HII region traced by 8.4 GHz radio continuum emission. This\nindicates that star formation activity of Onsala 1 could move from the west\nside of ultracompact HII region to the east side of two young stellar objects\nassociated with the water masers. We also find that WMC1 and UC HII region\ncould be gravitationally bound. Their relative velocity along the line of sight\nis 3 km/s, and total mass is 37 Mo.

841	0711.1386	Relativistic Radiation Hydrodynamical Accretion Disk Winds	2007-11-08	\N	\N	  Accretion disk winds browing off perpendicular to a luminous disk are\nexamined in the framework of fully special relativistic radiation\nhydrodynamics. The wind is assumed to be steady, vertical, and isothermal. %and\nthe gravitational fields is approximated by a pseudo-Newtonian potential. Using\na velocity-dependent variable Eddington factor, we can solve the rigorous\nequations of relativistic radiative hydrodynamics, and can obtain radiatively\ndriven winds accelerated up to the {\\it relativistic} speed. For less luminous\ncases, disk winds are transonic types passing through saddle type critical\npoints, and the final speed of winds increases as the disk flux and/or the\nisothermal sound speed increase. For luminous cases, on the other hand, disk\nwinds are always supersonic, since critical points disappear due to the\ncharacteristic nature of the disk gravitational fields. The boundary between\nthe transonic and supersonic types is located at around $\\hat{F}_{\\rm c} \\sim\n0.1 (\\epsilon+p)/(\\rho c^2)/\\gamma_{\\rm c}$, where $\\hat{F}_{\\rm c}$ is the\nradiative flux at the critical point normalized by the local Eddington\nluminosity, $(\\epsilon+p)/(\\rho c^2)$ is the enthalpy of the gas divided by the\nrest mass energy, and $\\gamma_{\\rm c}$ is the Lorentz factor of the wind\nvelocity at the critical point.

In such an\nequilibrium flow the usual limb-darkening effect does not appear, since the\nsource function is constant.

Relativistic radiation hydrodynamics under the moment formalism has\nseveral complex problems, such as a closure relation. Conventional moment\nequations closed with the traditional Eddington approximation in the comoving\nframe have singularity, beyond which the flow cannot be accelerated. In order\nto avoid such a pathological behavior inherent in the relativistic moment\nformalism, we propose a variable Eddington factor, which depends on the flow\nvelocity as well as the optical depth, for the case of the sperically symmertic\none-dimensional flow. We then calculate the relaticistic spherical flow with\nsuch variable Eddington factors to investigate the case that gas is accelerated\nby radiative force.

In a more narrow sense\nspintronics is an emerging research field of electronics: spintronics devices\nare based on a spin control of electronics, or on an electrical and optical\ncontrol of spin or magnetism. This review presents selected themes of\nsemiconductor spintronics, introducing important concepts in spin transport,\nspin injection, Silsbee-Johnson spin-charge coupling, and spindependent\ntunneling, as well as spin relaxation and spin dynamics. The most fundamental\nspin-dependent nteraction in nonmagnetic semiconductors is spin-orbit coupling.\nDepending on the crystal symmetries of the material, as well as on the\nstructural properties of semiconductor based heterostructures, the spin-orbit\ncoupling takes on different functional forms, giving a nice playground of\neffective spin-orbit Hamiltonians. The effective Hamiltonians for the most\nrelevant classes of materials and heterostructures are derived here from\nrealistic electronic band structure descriptions. Most semiconductor device\nsystems are still theoretical concepts, waiting for experimental\ndemonstrations. A review of selected proposed, and a few demonstrated devices\nis presented, with detailed description of two important classes: magnetic\nresonant tunnel structures and bipolar magnetic diodes and transistors. In most\ncases the presentation is of tutorial style, introducing the essential\ntheoretical formalism at an accessible level, with case-study-like\nillustrations of actual experimental results, as well as with brief reviews of\nrelevant recent achievements in the field.\n	10.2478/v10155-010-0086-8	cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.other	tutorial review; 342 pages, 132 figures

852	0711.1851	The Effros-Ruan conjecture for bilinear forms on C^*-algebras	2007-11-12	2007-12-02	\N	  In 1991 Effros and Ruan conjectured that a certain Grothendieck-type\ninequality for a bilinear form on C$^*$-algebras holds if (and only if) the\nbilinear form is jointly completely bounded. In 2002 Pisier and Shlyakhtenko\nproved that this inequality holds in the more general setting of operator\nspaces, provided that the operator spaces in question are exact. Moreover, they\nproved that the conjecture of Effros and Ruan holds for pairs of\nC$^*$-algebras, of which at least one is exact. In this paper we prove that the\nEffros-Ruan conjecture holds for general C$^*$-algebras, with constant one.\nMore precisely, we show that for every jointly completely bounded (for short,\nj.c.b.) bilinear form on a pair of C$^*$-algebras $A$ and $B$, there exist\nstates $f_1$, $f_2$ on $A$ and $g_1$, $g_2$ on $B$ such that for all $a\\in A$\nand $b\\in B$,\n  |u(a, b)| \\leq ||u||_{jcb}(f_1(aa^*)^{1/2}g_1(b^*b)^{1/2} +\nf_2(a^*a)^{1/2}g_2(bb^*)^{1/2}) .\n  While the approach by Pisier and Shlyakhtenko relies on free probability\ntechniques, our proof uses more classical operator algebra theory, namely,\nTomita-Takesaki theory and special properties of the Powers factors of type\nIII$_\\lambda$, $0< \\lambda< 1$ .\n	10.1007/s00222-008-0137-7	math.OA math.FA	18 pages

In\nregions of the crystal with a highly nonuniform deformation such as around\ndefects, every atom must be a representative atom to obtain sufficient\naccuracy, but the mesh can be coarsened away from such regions to remove\natomistic degrees of freedom while retaining sufficient accuracy. We present an\nerror estimator and a related adaptive mesh refinement algorithm for the\nquasicontinuum approximation of a generalized Frenkel-Kontorova model that\nenables a quantity of interest to be efficiently computed to a predetermined\naccuracy.\n	10.1016/j.cma.2008.05.005	math.NA math-ph math.MP	15 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables

By employing previously calculated\nresults for the energy dependence of the recombination rate of Helium-4 atoms,\nwe obtain three independent scaling functions that are capable of describing\nthe recombination rates over a large energy range for identical bosons with\nlarge scattering length. We benchmark these and previously obtained scaling\nfunctions by successfully comparing their predictions with full atom-dimer\nphase shift calculations with artificial Helium-4 potentials yielding large\nscattering lengths. Exploiting universality, we finally use these functions to\ndetermine the 3-body recombination rate of Cesium-133 atoms with large positive\nscattering length, compare our results to experimental data obtained by the\nInnsbruck group and find excellent agreement.\n	10.1103/PhysRevA.78.062717	cond-mat.other nucl-th	13 pages, 7 figures, agrees with published version, title changed

859	0711.2101	Central Spiral Structure of Molecular Gas in Maffei 2	2007-11-13	\N	\N	  Distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the central region of the\nbarred spiral galaxy Maffei 2 were investigated using a data set of 12CO(1-0),\n12CO(2-1), CS(2-1) lines and 103 GHz continuum. We found that the offset ridges\nalong the kpc-scale bar continue to the central spiral structure embedded in\nthe weak oval structure which is regarded as x2 orbit in the bar potential. The\nspiral structure continues toward the center diverging from the oval structure.\nThe size of these structures is less than R ~ 100 pc. The mass concentration\nwithin R = 35 pc is estimated to be 2 X 10^8 Mo. The high mass concentration is\nconsistent with theoretical predictions concerning the creation of such a\nnuclear spiral structure. A comparison with the tracers of dense gas and\nstar-forming region suggests that the dense molecular gas traced by CS(2-1)\nline is formed at the crossing points of x1 and x2 orbits and the star-forming\nregion appears after 2 X 10^5 yr which is comparable with the free-fall time of\nthe dense gas traced by the CS line (~ 10^5 cm^-3).\n	10.1093/pasj/60.3.475	astro-ph	7 pages, 10 figures, Publication of Astronomical Society of Japan, in\n  press

For\nexample, the answers to the questions "Where to search" and "Where to send" are\nequivalent, in that both require an identical selection from the same target\nstar lists. Similar considerations lead to a strategy of time synchronization\nbetween sending and searching. Both SETI and METI use large reflectors. The\nconcept of "magic frequencies" may be applicable to both SETI and METI. Efforts\nto understand an alien civilization's Interstellar Messages (IMs), and efforts\nto compose our own IMs so they will be easily understood by unfamiliar\nExtraterrestrials, are mutually complementary. Furthermore, the METI-question:\n"How can we benefit from sending IMs, if a response may come only thousands of\nyears later?" begs an equivalent SETI-question: "How can we benefit from\nsearching, if it is impossible now to perceive the motivations and feelings of\nthose who may have sent messages in the distant past?" A joint consideration of\nthe theoretical and the practical aspects of both sending and searching for\nIMs, in the framework of a unified, disciplined scientific approach, can be\nquite fruitful.

As a roughly estimation, we\ncalculate their branching ratios and CP asymmetries in Perturbative QCD\napproach. The branching ratio of $B\\to D^0\\bar D^0$ is about $3.8\\times10^{-5}$\nthat is just below the latest experimental upper limit. The branching ratio of\n$B_s\\to D^0\\bar D^0$ is about $6.8\\times10^{-4}$, which could be measured in\nLHC-b. From the calculation, it could be found that this branching ratio is not\nsensitive to the weak phase angle $\\gamma$. In these two decay modes, there\nexist CP asymmetries because of interference between weak and strong\ninteraction. However, these asymmetries are too small to be measured easily.\n	10.1088/1674-1137/32/10/003	hep-ph	13 pages, 4 figures
873	0711.2510	Dusty disks at the bottom of the IMF	2007-11-15	\N	\N	  'Isolated planetary mass objects' (IPMOs) have masses close to or below the\nDeuterium-burning mass limit (~15 Jupiter masses) -- at the bottom of the\nstellar initial mass function. We present an exploratory survey for disks in\nthis mass regime, based on a dedicated observing campaign with the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope. Our targets include the full sample of spectroscopically\nconfirmed IPMOs in the Sigma Orionis cluster, a total of 18 sources. In the\nmass range 8... 20 MJup, we identify 4 objects with >3sigma colour excess at a\nwavelength of 8.0mu, interpreted as emission from dusty disks. We thus\nestablish that a substantial fraction of IPMOs harbour disks with lifetimes of\nat least 2-4 Myr (the likely age of the cluster), indicating an origin from\ncore collapse and fragmentation processes. The disk frequency in the IPMO\nsample is 29% (16-45%) at 8.0mu, very similar to what has been found for stars\nand brown dwarfs (~30%). The object SOri70, a candidate 3 MJup object in this\ncluster, shows IRAC colours in excess of the typical values for field T dwarfs\n(on a 2sigma level), possibly due to disk emission or low gravity. This is a\nnew indication for youth and thus an extremely low mass for SOri70.\n	10.1086/526340	astro-ph	12 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL
874	0711.2529	The Effect of Large-Scale Power on Simulated Spectra of the Lya forest	2007-11-15	2007-11-30	\N	  We study the effects of box size on ENZO simulations of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) at z = 2. We follow statistics of the cold dark matter (CDM) and\nthe Lya absorption. We find that the larger boxes have fewer pixels with\nsignificant absorption (flux < 0.96) and more pixels in longer stretches with\nlittle or no absorption, and they have wider Lya lines. We trace these effect\nback to the additional power in larger boxes from longer wavelength modes. The\nIGM in our larger boxes is hotter, from increased pressure heating due to\nfaster hydrodynamical infall. When we increase the photoheating in smaller\nboxes to compensate, their Lya statistics change to mimic those of a box of\ntwice the size. Statistics converge towards their value in the largest (76.8\nMpc) box, except for the most common value of the CDM density which continues\nto rise. When we compare to errors with data, we find that our 76.8 Mpc box is\nlarger than we need for the mean flux, barely large enough for the column\ndensity distribution and the power spectrum of the flux, and too small for the\nline widths. This box with 75 kpc cells has approximately the same mean flux as\nQSO spectra, but the Lya lines are too wide by 2.6 km/s, there are too few\nlines with log H I column densities > 10^17 cm^-2, and the power of the flux is\ntoo low by 20 - 50%, from small to large scales. Four times smaller cell size\ndoes not resolve these differences, nor do simple changes to the ultraviolet\nbackground that drives the H and He II ionization. It is hard to see how\nsimulations using popular cosmological and astrophysical parameters can match\nLyman-alpha forest data at z=2.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14196.x	astro-ph	\N

In addition to clear spin modulation in the 0.5--10 keV band of\nthe XIS data at the barycentric period of 33.0769 \\pm 0.0001 s, the 10--30 keV\nHXD data in the second half of the 2005 observation also showed statistically\nsignificant periodic signals at a consistent period. On that occasion, the\nspin-folded HXD light curve exhibited two sharp spikes separated by about 0.2\ncycles in phase, in contrast to approximately sinusoidal profiles observed in\nenergies below about 4 keV. The folded 4--10 keV XIS light curves are\nunderstood as a superposition of those two types of pulse profiles. The phase\naveraged 1.5--10 keV spectra can be reproduced by two thermal components with\ntemperatures of $2.90_{-0.16}^{+0.20}$ keV and $0.53_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ keV, but\nthe 12-25 keV HXD data show a significant excess above the extrapolated model.\nThis excess can be explained by either a power-law model with photon index of\n$1.12_{-0.62}^{+0.63}$ or a third thermal component with a temperature of\n$54_{-47}^{+26}$ keV. At a distance of 102 pc, the 4--30 keV luminosities of\nthe thermal and the additional components become $1.7_{-0.6}^{+1.3}$ and\n$5.3_{-0.3}^{+15.3} \\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively.

880	0711.2772	The effect of energy amplification variance on the shock-acceleration	2007-11-18	\N	Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc. 383 (2008) 1431	  The shock-acceleration theory predicts a power-law energy spectrum in the\ntest particle approximation, and there are two ways to calculate a power-law\nindex, Peacock's approximation and Vietri's formulation. In Peacock's\napproximation, it is assumed that particles cross a shock front many times and\nenergy-gains for each step are fully uncorrelated. On the other hand,\ncorrelation of the distribution of an energy-gain factor for a particle is\nconsidered in Vietri's formulation. We examine how Peacock's approximation\ndiffers from Vietri's formulation. It is useful to know when we can use\nPeacock's approximation because Peacock's approximation is simple to derive the\npower-law index. In addition, we focus on how the variance of the energy-gain\nfactor has an influence on the difference between Vietri's formulation and\nPeacock's approximation. The effect of the variance has not been examined well\nuntil now. For demonstration, we consider two cases for the scattering in the\nupstream: the large-angle scattering (model A) and the regular deflection by\nlarge-scale magnetic fields (model B). Especially there is no correlation among\nthe distribution of an energy-gain factor for every step in model A. In this\nmodel, we see the power-law index derived from Peacock's approximation differs\nfrom the one derived from Vietri's formulation when we consider the\nmildly-relativistic shock, and the variance of the energy-gain factor affects\nthis difference. We can use Peacock's approximation for a non-relativistic\nshock and a highly-relativistic shock because the effect of the variance is\nhidden. In model B, we see the difference of the power-law converging along the\nshock velocity.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12630.x	astro-ph	8 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
881	0711.2831	Discovery of a WZ Sge-Type Dwarf Nova, SDSS J102146.44+234926.3:\n  Unprecedented Infrared Activity during a Rebrightening Phase	2007-11-18	\N	\N	  Several SU UMa-type dwarf novae, in particular, WZ Sge-type stars tend to\nexhibit rebrightenings after superoutbursts. The rebrightening phenomenon is\nproblematic for the disk instability theory of dwarf novae since it requires a\nlarge amount of remnant matter in the disk even after superoutbursts. Here, we\nreport our optical and infrared observations during the first-ever outburst of\na new dwarf nova, SDSS J102146.44+234926.3. During the outburst, we detected\nsuperhumps with a period of 0.056281 +/- 0.000015 d, which is typical for\nsuperhump periods in WZ Sge stars. In conjunction with the appearance of a\nlong-lived rebrightening, we conclude that the object is a new member of WZ Sge\nstars. Our observations, furthermore, revealed infrared behaviors for the first\ntime in the rebrightening phase of WZ Sge stars. We discovered prominent\ninfrared superhumps. We calculate the color temperature of the infrared\nsuperhump source to be 4600-6400 K. These temperatures are too low to be\nexplained with a fully-ionized disk appearing during dwarf nova outbursts. We\nalso found a Ks-band excess over the hot disk component. These unprecedented\ninfrared activities provide evidence for the presence of mass reservoir at the\noutermost part of the accretion disk. We propose that a moderately high\nmass-accretion rate at this infrared active region leads to the long-lived\nrebrightening observed in SDSS J102146.44+234926.3.\n	10.1093/pasj/60.2.227	astro-ph	11 pages, 10 figures.

Hinode observations revealed the existence of many bright points in\ncoronal holes. They are loop-shaped and sometimes associated with coronal jets.\nSpectra obtained with the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on\nboard Hinode are analyzed to infer Doppler velocity of bright loops and jets in\na coronal hole of the north polar region. Elongated jets above bright loops are\nfound to be blue-shifted by 30 km/s at maximum, while foot points of bright\nloops are red-shifted. Blue-shifts detected in coronal jets are interpreted as\nupflows produced by magnetic reconnection between emerging flux and the ambient\nfield in the coronal hole.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S757	astro-ph	11 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ Hinode special\n  issue
883	0711.2852	Instability of Population III Black Hole Accretion Disks	2007-11-19	\N	\N	  We investigate the stability of black hole accretion disks in a primordial\nenvironment (POP III disks for short), by solving the vertical structure of\noptically thick disks, including convective energy transport, and by employing\na one-zone model for optically thin isothermal disks. Because of the absence of\nmetals in POP III disks, we find significant differences in stability\nassociated with ionization between POP III disks and the disks of solar\nmetallicity. An unstable branch in S-shaped equilibrium curves on the\nMdot-Sigma (mass accretion rate - surface density) plane extends to a larger\nsurface density compared with the case of disks of solar metallicity. The\nresulting equilibrium loci indicate that quasi-periodic oscillations in\nluminosity can also be driven in POP III disks, and their maximal luminosity is\ntypically by an order of magnitude larger than that of the disks of solar\nmetallicity. Such a strong outburst of POP III disks can be observed by future\nhuge telescopes, in case that the mass is supplied onto the disks at the Bondi\naccretion rates in typical virialized small dark halos.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.6.1235	astro-ph	7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ

One\nof the characteristic features of these lightlike p-branes is that the brane\ntension appears as an additional nontrivial dynamical world-volume degree of\nfreedom. Codimension one lightlike brane dynamics requires that bulk space with\na bulk metric of spherically symmetric type must possess an event horizon which\nis automatically occupied by the lightlike brane while its tension evolves\nexponentially with time.

885	0711.2887	Modelling the Global Solar Corona II: Coronal Evolution and Filament\n  Chirality Comparison	2007-11-19	\N	\N	  The hemispheric pattern of solar filaments is considered using\nnewly-developed simulations of the real photospheric and 3D coronal magnetic\nfields over a 6-month period, on a global scale. The magnetic field direction\nin the simulation is compared directly with the chirality of observed\nfilaments, at their observed locations. In our model the coronal field evolves\nthrough a continuous sequence of nonlinear force-free equilibria, in response\nto the changing photospheric boundary conditions and the emergence of new\nmagnetic flux. In total 119 magnetic bipoles with properties matching observed\nactive regions are inserted. These bipoles emerge twisted and inject magnetic\nhelicity into the solar atmosphere. When we choose the sign of this\nactive-region helicity to match that observed in each hemisphere, the model\nproduces the correct chirality for up to 96% of filaments, including exceptions\nto the hemispheric pattern. If the emerging bipoles have zero helicity, or\nhelicity of the opposite sign, then this percentage is much reduced. In\naddition, the simulation produces a higher proportion of filaments with the\ncorrect chirality after longer times. This indicates that a key element in the\nevolution of the coronal field is its long-term memory, and the build-up and\ntransport of helicity from low to high latitudes over many months. It\nhighlights the importance of continuous evolution of the coronal field, rather\nthan independent extrapolations at different times. This has significant\nconsequences for future modelling such as that related to the origin and\ndevelopment of coronal mass ejections.\n	10.1007/s11207-007-9097-0	astro-ph	21 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Solar Physics\n  (Springer)

In the low pressure regime (P ~ 0-1 GPa) we assess\nexcellent agreement with experiments and we give an accurate description of the\natomic kinetic energy, Lindemann ratio and Debye temperature over a wide range\nof molar volumes (22-6 cm^{3}/mol). However, on moving to higher pressures our\ncalculated P-V curve presents an increasingly steeper slope which ultimately\nprovides differences within ~40 % with respect to measurements. In order to\naccount for many-body interactions arising in the crystal with compression\nwhich are not reproduced by our model, we perform additional electronic\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) calculations for correcting the computed DMC\nenergies in a perturbative way. We explore both generalized gradient and local\ndensity approximations (GGA and LDA, respectively) for the electronic\nexchange-correlation potential. By proceeding in this manner, we show that\ndiscrepancies with respect to high pressure data are reduced to 5-10 % with few\ncomputational extra cost.

Extreme\nfrequency filtering is performed for THz order of broadband PDC light and the\nfrequency bandwidth of the light is reduced to MHz order. Storage and retrieval\nprocedures are carried out for the frequency filtered PDC photons. Since the\nfiltered bandwidth [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 9 MHz] is within the\nEIT window (FWHM = 12.6 MHz), the flux of the PDC light is successfully stored\nand retrieved. The nonclassicality of the retrieved light is confirmed by using\nphoton counting method, where the classical inequality which is only satisfied\nfor classical light fields is introduced.

Japan 60, pp.327-335 (2008)	  Both continuum and emission line flickering are phenomena directly associated\nwith the mass accretion process. In this work we simulate accretion disk\nDoppler maps including the effects of winds and flickering flares. Synthetic\nflickering Doppler maps are calculated and the effect of the flickering\nparameters on the maps is explored. Jets and winds occur in many astrophysical\nobjects where accretion disks are present. Jets are generally absent among the\ncataclysmic variables (CVs), but there is evidence of mass loss by wind in many\nobjects. CVs are ideal objects to study accretion disks and consequently to\nstudy the wind associated with these disks. We also present simulations of\naccretion disks including the presence of a wind with orbital phase resolution.\nSynthetic H-alpha line profiles in the optical region are obtained and their\ncorresponding Doppler maps are calculated. The effect of the wind simulation\nparameters on the wind line profiles is also explored. From this study we\nverified that optically thick lines and/or emission by diffuse material into\nthe primary Roche lobe are necessary to generate single peaked line profiles,\noften seen in CVs. The future accounting of these effects is suggested for\ninterpreting Doppler tomography reconstructions.\n	10.1093/pasj/60.2.327	astro-ph	9 pages, 9 figures

This is a constructive approach which\ngives the potential as well as the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues\nsimultaneously. The novel feature of the present work is the realization that\nboth exact and quasi-exact solvabilities can be solely classified by two\nintegers, the degrees of two polynomials which determine the change of variable\nand the zero-th order prepotential. Most of the well-known exactly and\nquasi-exactly solvable models, and many new quasi-exactly solvable ones, can be\ngenerated by appropriately choosing the two polynomials.

902	0711.3812	Regulatory control and the costs and benefits of biochemical noise	2007-11-23	2008-05-03	\N	  Experiments in recent years have vividly demonstrated that gene expression\ncan be highly stochastic. How protein concentration fluctuations affect the\ngrowth rate of a population of cells, is, however, a wide open question. We\npresent a mathematical model that makes it possible to quantify the effect of\nprotein concentration fluctuations on the growth rate of a population of\ngenetically identical cells. The model predicts that the population's growth\nrate depends on how the growth rate of a single cell varies with protein\nconcentration, the variance of the protein concentration fluctuations, and the\ncorrelation time of these fluctuations. The model also predicts that when the\naverage concentration of a protein is close to the value that maximizes the\ngrowth rate, fluctuations in its concentration always reduce the growth rate.\nHowever, when the average protein concentration deviates sufficiently from the\noptimal level, fluctuations can enhance the growth rate of the population, even\nwhen the growth rate of a cell depends linearly on the protein concentration.\nThe model also shows that the ensemble or population average of a quantity,\nsuch as the average protein expression level or its variance, is in general not\nequal to its time average as obtained from tracing a single cell and its\ndescendants. We apply our model to perform a cost-benefit analysis of gene\nregulatory control. Our analysis predicts that the optimal expression level of\na gene regulatory protein is determined by the trade-off between the cost of\nsynthesizing the regulatory protein and the benefit of minimizing the\nfluctuations in the expression of its target gene. We discuss possible\nexperiments that could test our predictions.\n	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000125	q-bio.MN q-bio.PE	Revised manuscript;35 pages, 4 figures, REVTeX4; to appear in PLoS\n  Computational Biology

Typical two-ribbon structure was observed, not\nonly in the chromospheric CaII H line but also in G-band and FeI 6302A line.\nThe high-resolution, seeing-free images achieved by SOT revealed, for the first\ntime, the sub-arcsec fine structures of the "white light" flare. The G-band\nflare ribbons on sunspot umbrae showed a sharp leading edge followed by a\ndiffuse inside, as well as previously known core-halo structure. The underlying\nstructures such as umbral dots, penumbral filaments and granules were visible\nin the flare ribbons. Assuming that the sharp leading edge was directly heated\nby particle beam and the diffuse parts were heated by radiative back-warming,\nwe estimate the depth of the diffuse flare emission using the intensity profile\nof the flare ribbon. We found that the depth of the diffuse emission is about\n100 km or less from the height of the source of radiative back-warming. The\nflare ribbons were also visible in the Stokes-V images of FeI 6302A, as a\ntransient polarity reversal. This is probably related to "magnetic transient"\nreported in the literature. The intensity increase in Stokes-I images indicates\nthat the FeI 6302A line was significantly deformed by the flare, which may\ncause such a magnetic transient.\n	10.1093/pasj/59.sp3.S807	astro-ph	14 pages, 7 figures, PASJ in press

During\nthe observation, the XIS was operated in 1/8 window option to achieve a time\nresolution of 1 s. Pulsations are clearly detected in the XIS light curves with\na barycenter corrected pulse period of 10.61063(2) s. The XIS pulse profile\nshows 3 peaks of different amplitudes with RMS fractional amplitude of ~11% in\n0.2--6.0 keV energy band. Though the source was observed with the HXD of\nSuzaku, the data is highly contaminated by the nearby bright X-ray source GX\n340+0 which was in the HXD field of view. The 1-10 keV XIS spectra are well\nfitted by two blackbody components. The temperatures of two blackbody\ncomponents are found to be 0.61+/-0.01 keV and 1.22+/-0.06 keV and the value of\nthe absorption column density is 1.73+/-0.03 x 10^{22} atoms cm^{-2}. The\nobserved source flux in 1-10 keV energy range is calculated to be 2.6 x\n10^{-11} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} with significant contribution from the soft\nblackbody component (kT = 0.61 keV). Pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of XIS\ndata shows that the flux of the soft blackbody component consists of three\nnarrow peaks, whereas the flux of the other component shows a single peak over\nthe pulse period of the AXP. The blackbody radii changes between 2.2-2.7 km and\n0.28-0.38 km (assuming the source distance to be 5 kpc) over pulse phases for\nthe soft and hard components, respectively.

Such an analysis yields a result\ndifferent from that obtained from the conventional analysis, in which the\nfitting is usually restricted to a region below 0.15 K.

Generally, for the mixed N-CNLS equations the bright\nand dark solitons can be split up in $(N-1)$ ways. By analysing the collision\ndynamics of these coupled bright and dark solitons systematically we point out\nthat for $N>2$, if the bright solitons appear in at least two components,\nnon-trivial effects like onset of intensity redistribution, amplitude dependent\nphase-shift and change in relative separation distance take place in the bright\nsolitons during collision. However their counterparts, the dark solitons,\nundergo elastic collision but experience the same amplitude dependent\nphase-shift as that of bright solitons. Thus in the mixed CNLS system there\nco-exist shape changing collision of bright solitons and elastic collision of\ndark solitons with amplitude dependent phase-shift, thereby influencing each\nother mutually in an intricate way.\n	10.1103/PhysRevA.77.013820	nlin.SI	Accepted for publication in Physical Review A

B 88, 134507 (2013)	  We explore p-wave pairing in a single-channel two-component Fermi system with\nunequal population near Feshbach resonance. Our analytical and numerical study\nreveal a rich superfluid (SF) ground state structure as a function of\nimbalance. In addition to the state $\\Delta_{\\pm 1} \\propto Y_{1\\pm 1}$, a\nmultitude of ``mixed'' SF states formed of linear combinations of $Y_{1m}$'s\ngive global energy minimum under a phase stability condition; these states\nexhibit variation in energy with the relative phase between the constituent gap\namplitudes. States with local energy minimum are also obtained. We provide a\ngeometric representation of the states. A $T$=0 polarization vs. p-wave\ncoupling phase diagram is constructed across the BEC-BCS regimes. With\nincreased polarization, the global minimum SF state may undergo a quantum phase\ntransition to the local minimum SF state.\n	10.1103/PhysRevB.88.134507	cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.other	5 pages, 3 figures

Universality, power-law scaling of the black hole mass,\nand scale echoing have given rise to the term "critical phenomena". They are\nexplained by the existence of exact solutions which are attractors within the\nblack hole threshold, that is, attractors of codimension one in phase space,\nand which are typically self-similar. Critical phenomena give a natural route\nfrom smooth initial data to arbitrarily large curvatures visible from infinity,\nand are therefore likely to be relevant for cosmic censorship, quantum gravity,\nastrophysics, and our general understanding of the dynamics of general\nrelativity.\n	10.12942/lrr-2007-5	gr-qc	51 pages, 5 figures.

Zvelindovsky, pp. 395-433 (Springer, Dordrecht,\n  2007)	  Soft materials, such as colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, and\nbiological systems, are typically multicomponent mixtures of macromolecules and\nsimpler components (e.g., microions, monomers, solvent) that can assemble into\ncomplex structures spanning broad length and time scales. Many characteristic\ntraits of soft matter, e.g., mechanical fragility, sensitivity to external\ninfluence, and tunable thermal and optical properties, emerge from a mingling\nof microscopic and mesoscopic constituents. Large asymmetries in size and\ncharge between macromolecules and microscopic components often make impractical\nthe explicit modeling of all degrees of freedom over physically significant\nlength and time scales. The complexity often can be reduced, however, by\npre-averaging (coarse-graining) the degrees of freedom of some microscopic\ncomponents, thus mapping the real system onto a simpler model of fewer\ncomponents, but governed by effective interparticle interactions. This chapter\nreviews the statistical mechanical foundations of effective interactions in\nsoft materials and discusses illustrative applications to charged colloids,\npolyelectrolytes, and colloid-polymer mixtures\n	10.1007/978-1-4020-6330-5_13	cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech	Chapter contributed to Nanostructured Soft Matter: Experiment,\n  Theory, Simulation and Perspectives, edited by A.

929	0711.4752	Causal Relationships between Eruptive Prominences and Coronal Mass\n  Ejections	2007-11-29	\N	\N	  A close association between eruptive prominences and CMEs, both slow and fast\nCMEs, was reported in many studies. Sometimes it is possible to follow the\nmaterial motion starting from the prominence (filament) activation to the CME\nin the high corona. Remnants of the prominence were found in the bright core of\nCMEs. However, detailed comparisons of the two phenomena reveal problems in\nexplaining CMEs as a continuation of filament eruptions in the upper corona.\nFor example, the heliolatitudes of the disappeared filaments and subsequent\ncoronal ejections sometimes differ by tens of degrees. In order to clear up the\nproblems of EP-CME association we tentatively analyse the more general question\nof the dynamics of a magnetic flux rope. Prominences and filaments are the best\ntracers of the flux ropes in the corona long before the beginning of the\neruption. A twisted flux rope is held by the tension of field lines of\nphotospheric sources until parameters of the system reach critical values and a\ncatastrophe happens. We suggest that the associated flux rope height above the\nphotosphere is one of these parameters and it is revealed by the height of the\nfilament. 80 filaments were analysed and we found that eruptive prominences\nwere near the so-called limit of stability a few days before their eruptions.\nWe suggest that a comparison of the real heights of prominences with the\ncalculated critical heights from magnetograms could be systematically used to\npredict filament eruptions and the corresponding CMEs.\n	10.5194/angeo-26-3025-2008	astro-ph	20 pages and 8 figures Invited paper presented at SoHO-20 in Gent\n  (Aug. 2007), in press in Ann.

We give detailed calculations of the rotations of the polarization vector\nof an EW caused by incident GWs from various directions and in various\npolarization states, and then analyze the accumulative effects on the\npolarization vector when the EW passes n cycles along the annular waveguide. We\nreexamine the feasibility and limitation of this method to detect GWs of high\nfrequency around 100 MHz, in particular, the relic gravitational waves (RGWs).\nBy comparing the spectrum of RGWs in the accelerating universe with the\ndetector sensitivity of the current waveguide, it is found that the amplitude\nof the RGWs is too low to be detected by the waveguide detectors currently\nrunning.

When two non-relativistic particles scatter in one dimension, they can become\nentangled. This entanglement process is constrained by the symmetries of the\nscattering system and the boundary conditions on the incoming state. Applying\nthese constraints, three different mechanisms of entanglement can be\nidentified: the superposition of reflected and transmitted modes, momentum\ncorrelations of the reflected mode due to inversion of the relative momentum,\nand momentum correlations in the transmitted and reflected modes due to\ndependence of the scattering amplitude on the relative momentum. We consider\nthree standard potentials, the hard core, Dirac delta, and double Dirac delta,\nand show that the relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the\ninteraction and on the properties of the incoming wave function. We find that\neven when the momenta distributions of the incoming articles are sharply\npeaked, entanglement due to the momentum correlations generated by reflection\ncan be quite large for particles with unequal mass.\n	10.1088/1751-8113/41/15/155304	quant-ph	14 pages IOP style, 5 figures, conference proceeding for QTS-5;\n  version 2 has some clarifications, corrections, and general improvements;\n  submitted to JPA

The\nvariation of the number density of stars of various ages with galactocentric\nradius and along the minor axis of the galaxy are determined. The boundaries of\nthe thin and thick disks of the galaxy are found. The inferred sizes of the\nsubsystems of NGC2366 ($Z_{thin} = 4$ kpc and $Z_{thick} = 8$ kpc for the thin\nand thick disks, respectively) are more typical for spiral galaxies.

A 41, 224009 (2008)	  We show that to correctly describe the position of the critical line in the\nKauffman random boolean networks one must take into account percolation\nphenomena underlying the process of damage spreading. For this reason, since\nthe issue of percolation transition is much simpler in random undirected\nnetworks, than in the directed ones, we study the Kauffman model in undirected\nnetworks. We derive the mean field formula for the critical line in the giant\ncomponent of these networks, and show that the critical line characterizing the\nwhole network results from the fact that the ordered behavior of small clusters\nshields the chaotic behavior of the giant component. We also show a possible\nattitude towards the analytical description of the shielding effect. The\ntheoretical derivations given in this paper quite tally with numerical\nsimulations done for classical random graphs.\n	10.1088/1751-8113/41/22/224009	cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech	submitted to Journal of Physics A, special issue "Complex networks"

The\nvolume of a region between two such levels depends on both levels. Fixing one\nof them the volume becomes a function of the remaining level. We show that if\nthe function f is smooth, the volume function is again smooth for regular\nvalues of f. For critical values of f the volume function is only finitely\ndifferentiable. The initial motivation for this study comes from Radiotherapy,\nwhere such volume functions are used in an optimization process.

It is found that the thermal conductivity\nof SiNWs can be reduced exponentially by isotopic defects at room temperature.\nThe thermal conductivity reaches the minimum, which is about 27% of that of\npure 28Si NW, when doped with fifty percent isotope atoms. The thermal\nconductivity of isotopic-superlattice structured SiNWs depends clearly on the\nperiod of superlattice. At a critical period of 1.09 nm, the thermal\nconductivity is only 25% of the value of pure Si NW. An anomalous enhancement\nof thermal conductivity is observed when the superlattice period is smaller\nthan this critical length. The ultra-low thermal conductivity of superlattice\nstructured SiNWs is explained with phonon spectrum theory.\n	10.1021/nl0725998	cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.other	Nano Lett., ASAP Article 10.1021/nl0725998 S1530-6984(07)02599-4 Web\n  Release Date: December 21, 2007

Whereas other theories\nhave been proposed in the past which realize the same, the present theory rests\non basic physical principles, in contrast to for instance the MOND theory. The\nkey to arrive at this new theory is to consider from the start the energy\ndensity of the vacuum. The way to calculate the effect of the corresponding\nvacuum pressure on a mass has previously been laid down by Van Nieuwenhove\n(1992). We obtain a modification of Newton's law of gravitation with some\npeculiar properties such as the occurrence of regions of repulsive gravity.\nBased on a newly derived equation of state of the vacuum, the Tully-Fisher\nrelation is derived. The theory can make detailed predictions about galaxy\nrotation curves and is also able to explain to the Pioneer anomaly, the foamy\ndistribution of galaxies and the observed accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse.

However, the physics of spin dependent\ntunneling through MgO barriers is only beginning to be unravelled. Using planar\nmagnetic tunnel junctions in which ultra-thin layers of magnetic metals are\ndeposited in the middle of a MgO tunnel barrier here we demonstrate that the\nTMR is strongly modified when these layers are discontinuous and composed of\nsmall pancake shaped nanodots. At low temperatures, in the Coulomb blockade\nregime, for layers less than ~1 nm thick, the conductance of the junction is\nincreased at low bias consistent with Kondo assisted tunneling. In the same\nregime we observe a suppression of the TMR. For slightly thicker layers, and\ncorrespondingly larger nanodots, the TMR is enhanced at low bias, consistent\nwith co-tunneling.\n	10.1021/nl072930n	cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall	Nano Letters (in press)

From the nuclear spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate $1/T_1$ and Knight-shift measurements, we confirmed that\nferromagnetic fluctuations which possess a quantum critical character are\npresent above $T_{\\rm Curie}$ and the occurrence of ferromagnetic transition at\n2.5 K in our polycrystalline sample.

The confinement potential has been parametrized by a\ntwo-centre power-exponential function, which allows us to investigate various\ntypes of QD's described by either soft or hard potentials of different range.\nFor the soft (Gaussian) confinement potential the exchange energy decreases\nwith increasing interdot distance due to the decreasing interdot tunnelling.\nFor the hard (rectangular-like) confinement potential we have found a\nnon-monotonic behaviour of the exchange interaction as a function of distance\nbetween the confinement potential centres. In this case, the exchange\ninteraction energy exhibits a pronounced maximum for the confinement potential\nprofile which corresponds to the nanostructure composed of the small inner QD\nwith a deep potential well embedded in the large outer QD with a shallow\npotential well. This effect results from the strong localization of electrons\nin the inner QD, which leads to the large singlet-triplet splitting.\nImplications of this finding for quantum logic operations have been discussed.\n	10.1088/0953-8984/20/21/215208	cond-mat.mes-hall	16 pages, including 11 figures

We show that if the poloidal\nmagnetic field near the BH horizon is misaligned with the BH rotation axis,\ncharged particles, which initially spiral into the BH hole along the equatorial\nplane, penetrate into the regions above the BH "polar caps" and are ejected\nwith high energies to infinity. We show that in such a model acceleration of\nprotons near a BH of typical mass 3e8 solar masses is possible only if the\nmagnetic field is almost aligned with the BH rotation axis. We find that the\npower of anisotropic electromagnetic emission from an UHECR source near a\nsupermassive BH should be at least 10-100 times larger then UHECR power of the\nsource. This implies that if the number of UHECR sources within the 100 Mpc\nsphere is ~100, the power of electromagnetic emission which accompanies proton\nacceleration in each source, $10^{42-43}$ erg/s, is comparable to the typical\nluminosities of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe. We also\nexplore the acceleration of heavy nuclei, for which the constraints on the\nelectromagnetic luminosity and on the alignment of magnetic field in the gap\nare relaxed.\n	10.1088/1367-2630/11/6/065015	astro-ph	\N

While the solar photospheric luminosity was about 30% lower\n4.6 Gyr ago when the Sun arrived on the main sequence compared to present-day\nlevels, its faster rotation generated enhanced magnetic activity; magnetic\nheating processes in the chromosphere, the transition region, and the corona\ninduced ultraviolet, extreme-ultraviolet, and X-ray emission about 10, 100, and\n1000 times, respectively, the present-day levels, as inferred from young\nsolar-analog stars. Also, the production rate of accelerated, high-energy\nparticles was orders of magnitude higher than in present-day solar flares, and\na much stronger wind escaped from the Sun, permeating the entire solar system.\nThe consequences of the enhanced radiation and particle fluxes from the young\nSun were potentially severe for the evolution of solar-system planets and\nmoons. Interactions of high-energy radiation and the solar wind with upper\nplanetary atmospheres may have led to the escape of important amounts of\natmospheric constituents. The present dry atmosphere of Venus and the thin\natmosphere of Mars may be a product of early irradiation and heating by solar\nhigh-energy radiation. High levels of magnetic activity are also inferred for\nthe pre-main sequence Sun. At those stages, interactions of high-energy\nradiation and particles with the circumsolar disk in which planets eventually\nformed were important.

976	0712.1765	Solving Simple Stochastic Games with Few Random Vertices	2007-12-11	2009-05-25	Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 5, Issue 2 (May 25,\n  2009) lmcs:1119	  Simple stochastic games are two-player zero-sum stochastic games with\nturn-based moves, perfect information, and reachability winning conditions. We\npresent two new algorithms computing the values of simple stochastic games.\nBoth of them rely on the existence of optimal permutation strategies, a class\nof positional strategies derived from permutations of the random vertices. The\n"permutation-enumeration" algorithm performs an exhaustive search among these\nstrategies, while the "permutation-improvement" algorithm is based on\nsuccessive improvements, \\`a la Hoffman-Karp. Our algorithms improve previously\nknown algorithms in several aspects. First they run in polynomial time when the\nnumber of random vertices is fixed, so the problem of solving simple stochastic\ngames is fixed-parameter tractable when the parameter is the number of random\nvertices. Furthermore, our algorithms do not require the input game to be\ntransformed into a stopping game. Finally, the permutation-enumeration\nalgorithm does not use linear programming, while the permutation-improvement\nalgorithm may run in polynomial time.\n	10.2168/LMCS-5(2:9)2009	cs.GT	\N

978	0712.1857	On Black Hole Mass Estimation from X-ray Spectra of Ultraluminous X-ray\n  Sources	2007-12-11	2008-05-07	\N	  We propose a methodology to derive a black-hole mass for super-critical\naccretion flow. Here, we use the extended disk blackbody (extended DBB) model,\na fitting model in which the effective temperature profile obeys the relation\n$T_{\\rm eff} \\propto r^{-p}$, with $r$ being the disk radius and $p$ being\ntreated as a fitting parameter. We first numerically calculate the theoretical\nflow structure and its spectra for a given black-hole mass, $M$, and accretion\nrate, $\\dot{M}$. Through fitting to the theoretical spectra by the extended DBB\nmodel, we can estimate the black-hole mass, $M_{\\rm x}$, assuming that the\ninnermost disk radius is $r_{\\rm in}=3r_{\\rm g} (\\propto M_{\\rm x})$, where\n$r_{\\rm g}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We find, however, that the estimated\nmass deviates from that adopted in the spectral calculations, $M$, even for\nlow-$\\dot{M}$ cases. We also find that the deviations can be eliminated by\nintroducing a new correction for the innermost radius. Using this correction,\nwe calculate mass correction factors, $M/M_{\\rm x}$, in the super-critical\nregimes for some sets of $M$ and $\\dot M$, finding that a mass correction\nfactor ranges between $M/M_{\\rm x} \\sim$ 1.2 -- 1.6. The higher is $\\dot{M}$,\nthe larger does the mass correction factor tend to be. Since the correction is\nrelatively small, we can safely conclude that the black holes in ULXs which\nVierdayanti et al. (2006, PASJ, 58, 915) analyzed are stellar-mass black holes\nwith the mass being $< 100M_{\\odot}$.\n	10.1093/pasj/60.3.653	astro-ph	14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables (accepted, PASJ, Vol.60 No.3).

979	0712.1866	Chemical Evolution in VeLLOs	2007-12-11	2007-12-13	\N	  A new type of object called "Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs)" has been\ndiscovered by the Spitzer Space Telescope. VeLLOs might be substellar objects\nforming by accretion. However, some VeLLOs are associated with strong outflows,\nindicating the previous existence of massive accretion. The thermal history,\nwhich significantly affects the chemistry, between substellar objects with a\ncontinuous low accretion rate and objects in a quiescent phase after massive\naccretion (outburst) must be greatly different. In this study, the chemical\nevolution has been calculated in an episodic accretion model to show that CO\nand N2H+ have a relation different from starless cores or Class 0/I objects.\nFurthermore, the CO2 ice feature at 15.2 micron will be a good tracer of the\nthermal process in VeLLOs.\n	10.5303/JKAS.2007.40.4.83	astro-ph	corrected e-mail address

It is observed that varying the oxidation\ntime modifies the magnetic properties of the Co layer, inducing a magnetic\nanisotropy crossover from in-plane to out-of-plane. We focused on the influence\nof plasma oxidation on Pt/Co/AlOx perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The\ninterfacial electronic structure is analyzed via X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy measurements. It is shown that the maximum of out-of-plane\nmagnetic anisotropy corresponds to the appearance of a significant density of\nCo-O bondings at the Co/AlOx interface.\n	10.1063/1.2969711	cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci	\N
981	0712.1913	CMB polarization constraints on radiative feedback	2007-12-12	\N	\N	  We compute the imprints left on the CMB by two cosmic reionization models\nconsistent with current observations but characterized by alternative radiative\nfeedback prescriptions (suppression and filtering) resulting in a different\nsuppression of star formation in low-mass halos. The models imply different\nionization and thermal histories and 21 cm background signals. The derived\nComptonization, u, and free-free distortion, y_B, parameters are below current\nobservational limits for both models. However, the value of u = 1.69 * 10^-7\n(9.65 * 10^-8) for the suppression (filtering) model is in the detectability\nrange of the next generation of CMB spectrum experiments. Through the dedicated\nBoltzmann code CMBFAST, modified to include the above ionization histories, we\ncompute the CMB angular power spectrum (APS) of the TT, TE, and EE modes. For\nthe EE mode the differences between these models are significantly larger than\nthe cosmic and sampling variance over the multipole range l = 5-15, leaving a\ngood chance of discriminating between these feedback mechanisms with\nforthcoming/future CMB polarization experiments. The main limitations come from\nforeground contamination: it should be subtracted at per cent level in terms of\nAPS, a result potentially achievable by novel component separation techniques\nand mapping of Galactic foreground.\n	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.12845.x	astro-ph	9 pages, 4 figures.

982	0712.1933	Recent progress on the notion of global hyperbolicity	2007-12-12	2010-02-25	\N	  Global hyperbolicity is a central concept in Mathematical Relativity. Here,\nwe review the different approaches to this concept explaining both, classical\napproaches and recent results. The former includes Cauchy hypersurfaces, naked\nsingularities, and the space of the causal curves connecting two events. The\nlatter includes structural results on globally hyperbolic spacetimes, their\nembeddability in Lorentz-Minkowski, and the recently revised notions of both,\ncausal and conformal boundaries. Moreover, two criteria for checking global\nhyperbolicity are reviewed. The first one applies to general splitting\nspacetimes. The second one characterizes accurately global hyperbolicity and\nspacelike Cauchy hypersurfaces for standard stationary spacetimes, in terms of\na naturally associated Finsler metric.\n	10.1051/eas:0830026	gr-qc	18 pages, 1 figure.

Here we highlight the interest of another approach to\nsuch problems, relying on quadratic algebras. We illustrate this point by\nconstructing spectrum generating algebras for a class of $d$-dimensional radial\nharmonic oscillators with $d\\ge2$ (including the one-dimensional oscillator on\nthe line via some minor changes) and a specific mass choice. This provides us\nwith a counterpart of the well-known su(1,1) Lie algebraic approach to the\nconstant-mass oscillators.\n	10.1088/1742-6596/128/1/012059	math-ph math.MP math.QA quant-ph	6 pages, no figure, communication at the 5th Int.

986	0712.2318	Mixed anomalies of chiral algebras compactified to smooth\n  quasi-projective surfaces	2007-12-14	2015-02-24	\N	  Some time ago, the chiral algebra theory of Beilinson-Drinfeld was expected\nto play a central role in the convergence of divergence in mathematical physics\nof superstring theory for quantization of gauge theory and gravity. Naively,\nthis algebra plays an important role in a holomorphic conformal field theory\nwith a non-negative integer graded conformal dimension, whose target space does\nnot necessarily have the vanishing first Chern class. This algebra has two\ndefinitions until now: one is that by Malikov-Schechtman-Vaintrob by gluing\naffine patches, and the other is that of Kapranov-Vasserot by gluing the formal\nloop spaces. I will use the new definition of Nekrasov by simplifying\nMalikov-Schechtman-Vaintrob in order to compute the obstruction classes of\ngerbes of chiral differential operators.\n  In this paper, I will examine the two independent Ans$\\"{a}$tze (or working\nhypotheses) of Witten's $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ heterotic strings and Nekrasov's\ngeneralized complex geometry, after Hitchin and Gualtieri, are consistent in\nthe case of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, which has $3$ affine patches and is expected to\nhave the "first Pontryagin anomaly".\n  I also scrutinized the physical meanings of $2$ dimensional toric Fano\nmanifolds, or rather toric del Pezzo surfaces, obtained by blowing up the\nnon-colinear $1, 2, 3$ points of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$. The obstruction classes of\ngerbes of them coincide with the second Chern characters obtained by the\nRiemann-Roch theorem and in particular vanishes for $1$ point blowup, which\nmeans that one of the gravitational anomalies vanishes for a non-Calabi-Yau\nmanifold compactification.\n  The future direction towards the geometric Langlands program is also\ndiscussed in the last section.\n	\N	hep-th math.AG	Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Tokyo, 2007, v2. changed the\n  arXiv address of reference, v3. eliminated some typos and references, v4.\n  introduced AMS format of LaTeX, v5. cleaned signs, fonts, and formats with\n  polite calculations

Quantum Chem. 108, p. 2428 (2008)	  Universal properties of the Coulomb interaction energy apply to all\nmany-electron systems. Bounds on the exchange-correlation energy, inparticular,\nare important for the construction of improved density functionals. Here we\ninvestigate one such universal property -- the Lieb-Oxford lower bound -- for\nionic and molecular systems. In recent work [J. Chem. Phys. 127, 054106\n(2007)], we observed that for atoms and electron liquids this bound may be\nsubstantially tightened. Calculations for a few ions and molecules suggested\nthe same tendency, but were not conclusive due to the small number of systems\nconsidered. Here we extend that analysis to many different families of ions and\nmolecules, and find that for these, too, the bound can be empirically tightened\nby a similar margin as for atoms and electron liquids. Tightening the\nLieb-Oxford bound will have consequences for the performance of various\napproximate exchange-correlation functionals.\n	10.1002/qua.21677	physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.atom-ph	8 pages, 3 color figures

Quantum Chem. 108, p. 2433 (2008)	  Phenomenological orbital-polarization (OP) terms have been repeatedly\nintroduced in the single-particle equations of spin-density-functional theory,\nin order to improve the description of orbital magnetic moments in systems\ncontaining transition metal ions. Here we show that these ad hoc corrections\ncan be interpreted as approximations to the exchange-correlation vector\npotential A_xc of current-density-functional theory (CDFT). This connection\nprovides additional information on both approaches: Phenomenological OP terms\nare connected to first-principles theory, leading to a rationale for their\nempirical success and a reassessment of their limitations and the\napproximations made in their derivation. Conversely, the connection of OP terms\nwith CDFT leads to a set of simple approximations to the CDFT potential A_xc,\nwith a number of desirable features that are absent from electron-gas-based\nfunctionals.\n	10.1002/qua.21784	cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.chem-ph	\N
989	0712.2357	At the Bottom of the Main Sequence: Activity and magnetic fields beyond\n  the threshold to complete convection	2007-12-14	2007-12-18	\N	  The bottom of the main sequence hosts objects with fundamentally different\nproperties. At masses of about 0.3 M$_{\\odot}$, stars become fully convective\nand at about 0.08 M$_{\\odot}$ the hydrogen-burning main sequence ends; less\nmassive objects are brown dwarfs. While stars and brown dwarfs experience very\ndifferent evolutions, their inner structure has relatively little impact on the\natmospheres. The generation of magnetic fields and activity is obviously\nconnected to the threshold between partial and complete convection, because\ndynamo mechanisms involving a layer of shear like the solar\n$\\alpha\\Omega$-dynamo must cease. Hence a change in stellar activity can be\nexpected there. Observations of stellar activity do not confirm a rapid break\nin activity at the convection boundary, but the fraction of active stars and\nrapid rotators is higher on the fully convective side. I summarize the current\npicture of stellar activity and magnetic field measurements at the bottom of\nthe main sequence and present recent results on rotational braking beyond.\n	10.1002/9783527622993.ch3	astro-ph	25 pages, 7 figures, Ludwig Biermann Lecture given at the annual\n  meeting of the German Astronomical Society, 2007, v2

Detailed spectral fits to the 6 and 15\nmicron features are made, using publicly-available laboratory data, to\nconstrain the molecular composition, abundances, and levels of thermal\nprocessing along the lines of sight. We provide an inventory of the molecular\nenvironments observed, which have an average composition dominated by water ice\nwith ~12% CO_2 (abundance relative to H_2O), >~2-9% CH_3OH, <~14% NH_3, ~4%\nCH_4, ~2% H_2CO, ~0.6% HCOOH, and ~0.5% SO_2. We find CO_2/H_2O ratios nearly\nequivalent to those observed in cold clouds and lines of sight toward the\ngalactic center. The unidentified 6.8 micron profiles vary from source to\nsource, and it is shown to be likely that even combinations of the most common\ncandidates (NH_4+ and CH_3OH) are inadequate to explain the feature fully. We\ndiscuss correlations among SED spectral indices, abundance ratios, and\nthermally-processed ice fractions and their implications for CO_2 formation and\nevolution. Comparison of our spectral fits with cold molecular cloud\nsight-lines indicates abundant prestellar ice environments made even richer by\nthe radiative effects of protostars.

We also characterize Baer-ness of regular rings\nusing near-open maps. The last part of this work will concentrate on\nclassifying the real closure * of Baer and non-Baer regular rings (upto\nisomorphisms) using continuous sections of the support map, we construct a\ntopology on this set for the Baer case. For the case of non-Baer regular rings,\nit will be shown that almost no information of the ring structure of the Baer\nhull is necessary in order to study the real and prime spectra of the Baer\nhull.

999	0712.3020	Operating Regimes of Signaling Cycles: Statics, Dynamics, and Noise\n  Filtering	2007-12-18	\N	\N	  A ubiquitous building block of signaling pathways is a cycle of covalent\nmodification (e.g., phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in MAPK cascades).\nOur paper explores the kind of information processing and filtering that can be\naccomplished by this simple biochemical circuit.\n  Signaling cycles are particularly known for exhibiting a highly sigmoidal\n(ultrasensitive) input-output characteristic in a certain steady-state regime.\nHere we systematically study the cycle's steady-state behavior and its response\nto time-varying stimuli. We demonstrate that the cycle can actually operate in\nfour different regimes, each with its specific input-output characteristics.\nThese results are obtained using the total quasi-steady-state approximation,\nwhich is more generally valid than the typically used Michaelis-Menten\napproximation for enzymatic reactions. We invoke experimental data that\nsuggests the possibility of signaling cycles operating in one of the new\nregimes.\n  We then consider the cycle's dynamic behavior, which has so far been\nrelatively neglected. We demonstrate that the intrinsic architecture of the\ncycles makes them act - in all four regimes - as tunable low-pass filters,\nfiltering out high-frequency fluctuations or noise in signals and environmental\ncues. Moreover, the cutoff frequency can be adjusted by the cell. Numerical\nsimulations show that our analytical results hold well even for noise of large\namplitude. We suggest that noise filtering and tunability make signaling cycles\nversatile components of more elaborate cell signaling pathways.\n	10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030246	q-bio.MN q-bio.BM q-bio.QM q-bio.SC	to appear in PLoS Computational Biology
